    "abstract_text": "Advances in cell culture techniques and stem cell technology have enabled generation of 3-\ndimensional organoids capable of recapitulating the structure and physiology of human organs\nbetter than 2D cultures. These organoids can aid in identifying early biomarkers of diseases, and\nunderstanding the impact of environmental factors on the initiation and progression of diseases.\nWe recently used our human heart organoids (hHOs) derived from human induced pluripotent\nstem cells (iPSCs) to explore changes in lipid profile mediated by endoplasmic reticulum (ER)\nstress sensor proteins.\nExogenous chemicals (e.g., per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), drugs, etc.) and\nendogenous metabolites (e.g., cholesterol and saturated fatty acids (SFAs)) negatively affect\ncardiac function. PFAS are found in many household cleaning products and commercial\npackaging materials. Once released to the environment, these “forever chemicals” degrade\nslowly, resulting in detectable levels in drinking water, food, and animals, including humans. PFAS\nare ubiquitous environmental contaminants that also accumulate in the food chain, which is one\nof the main routes of human exposure. Evidence have linked PFAS to altered lipid profile and\ncardiovascular disease (CVD). We and others have found that PFAS induces ER stress, notably\ninositol-requiring enzyme 1α (IRE1α) signaling. ER stress and activation of IRE1α is involved in\nvarious conditions that advance heart diseases. Thus far, studies on the changes in lipid\ncomposition induced by PFAS has been limited to cholesterol, lipoproteins and TG. We found that\n(i) IRE1α mediates changes in the lipid profile (notably, long-chain fatty acids) in our hHOs, and\n(ii) PFAS activates IRE1α signaling and is linked to dyslipidemia and CVD risk. Therefore, we\nhypothesize that PFAS activation of IRE1α signaling alters the lipid profiles and negatively affects\ncardiac function. We further propose that our organoids, which contain epicardial cells (that\nprovide trophic factors and can mediate lipid metabolism) in addition to cardiomyocytes, enable\ninvestigation of the influence of epicardial cells on the cardiac lipid profile and function. In the first\naim, we will investigate the changes in lipid content (i.e., very long chain long chain fatty acids:\nodd and even) and cardiac function induced by PFAS exposure and mediated by IRE1α. In the\nsecond aim, we will investigate the PFAS-induced changes in lipid profile and cardiac function\nmediated by the epicardium.",

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nThis proposal will develop a multi-functional interface to measure and modulate the activity of neural organoid\ncultures. The first generation of this Compliant Reversible Actuator and Detector Leveraging Electrophysiology\n(Organoid-CRADLE) will include a multi-electrode array (MEA) and light-emitting diodes (LEDs) for optogenetic\nexperiments. The LEDs will interface with NeuroLux’s existing suite of hardware and software for optogenetic\nexperiments, while the MEA will interface with hardware from other established vendors. The Organoid-CRADLE\nwill have several transformational advantages over status quo technologies. The Organoid-CRADLE will use a\nrevolutionary soft robotic structure to grip non-adherent organoid cultures and position electrodes and µLEDs on\nthe organoid surface. Conventional MEAs are flat, making them incompatible with the curved shape of an\norganoid. Even next-generation 3D MEAs that are curved for compatibility with organoids currently have a static\nshape. Therefore, it is difficult to design them to perform well with multiple organoids because organoids vary\nsignificantly in size and shape, even within a single batch. Our device solves this problem because it has soft\narms that gradually curl up from a flat position when pressurized. Instead of being designed to match the shape\nof a target organoid, the device is designed to conform to the size and shape of whatever organoid it encounters,\nmaking it much more versatile than other state-of-the-art devices. Another problem with competing devices is\nthat the contact is not reversible. The Organoid-CRADLE can disengage from the organoid at any time without\ndamaging the device or injuring the organoid. As a result, a single device can record from several different\norganoids in rotation. Also, an organoid that is used for recording can be released unharmed for use in other\nprocedures. Neither of these approaches is possible with competing devices and both will be highly valued by\nour target customers. We will prepare this revolutionary product for market by focusing on its geometry, MEA\nfunctionality, and optical stimulation functionality. We will optimize the geometry to maximize contact area without\ninducing injury. We will demonstrate that an array of electrodes can be embedded in the device and validate\ntheir ability to record the activity of the organoid. Finally, we will demonstrate that tiny µLEDs can be attached to\nthe device and used to induce activity in appropriately-prepared, light sensitive organoids. The capacity to\ncapture an organoid without injuring it and then release it is useful independent of the other functionality of the\ndevice. Similarly, MEA and optical stimulation functionality are also independently valuable. In combination,\nthese features will move organoid electrophysiology from being a challenging assay available only to large, well-\nresourced labs to being a routine assay available to startups and small academic labs across the world.\nTherefore, we anticipate that this product will not only quickly dominate the market for organoid electrophysiology\nbut also ultimately expand it by making it more accessible.",

    "abstract_text": "Without the occurrence of cancer cell dissemination (metastasis), most breast cancer patients would\nsurvive following diagnosis and treatment. Alas, cancer cells can disseminate to distant sites long\nbefore diagnosis of the primary tumor. Based on clinical investigations, bone is established as the most\npredominant site of metastasis in breast cancer. Over the years, we started to realize a preferential\nassociation of breast cancer subtypes with certain metastatic sites. For instance, hormone receptor-\npositive (HR+) breast cancer, which represents the most common subtype of breast cancer (65-70%),\nhas a high propensity toward skeletal tissues compared to HR- subtypes (TNBC and HR-/Her2+).\nAccumulating evidence indicates a key role of bone resident cells (osteoblasts, osteoclasts, and\nvascular cells) in these processes. Although multiple mechanisms can contribute to these processes,\nthe clinical implications remain limited. Recently, we identified a bone-induced factor (NRG3) that may\nhelp switch current paradigms. NRG3 is part of the neuregulin family of ligands that modulate erbb\nreceptors. While the role of Neuregulins is still enigmatic in breast cancer, our preliminary results\nsuggest strong implications in metastasis progression. Here, we will use molecular approaches to (i)\ndetermine and functionally characterize the NRG3 regulome induced in the bone microenvironment, (ii)\nidentify the NRG3 signaling using genetic approaches, and (iii) assess the impact of NRG3 depletion\non secondary metastasis. Considering the well-established role of Receptor Tyrosine Kinases such as\nHer2 in stemness, DTC, and metastasis progression, our proposed investigation may uncover novel\nbone-mediated properties with high therapeutic potential.",

    "abstract_text": "ABSTRACT\nThere is an urgent need to nominate biomarkers that are likely to predict the efficacy of radiotherapy and\naccelerate their clinical translation. Efforts thus far have been limited in large part because the omic features\nregulating tumor cell survival and their frequency across and within individual cancer types had not been studied.\nAlso, radiation is one of the most utilized therapeutic modalities in cancer. Despite this, radiotherapy dose is still\ndelivered using a ‘one size fits most’ paradigm and has not yet lent itself to personalization based on genetic\nfeatures. Our group of investigators have expertise that spans several aspects of the study of translational lung\nradiotherapy including advanced functional genomics, use of pre-clinical models of human tumors,\npersonalized therapeutic interventions, bioinformatics, computational biology, and clinical research. Collectively,\nwe have: (1) completed the largest profiling effort of the genetic vulnerability of cancer cells to irradiation to date\n(533 cell lines); (2) completed an arrayed unary (one mutation per well) gene variant cellular profiling project that\nhas interrogated ~400 common and rare genetic variants for response to ionizing radiation in cells; (3) developed\nnew functional genomic tools to study genome-phenome associations at scale; (4) developed over 500\ngenetically and clinically annotated patient derived xenograft (PDXs), subset of ex vivo and 3D models for testing\nusing a radiation platform and (5), developed new computational tools and frameworks to personalize radiation\ndose treatments. The major themes for this proposal are: (i) analyze matched pre- and post-radiotherapy\ngenomes from patient tissue and using PDX to elucidate mechanisms of de novo and/or acquired resistance; (ii)\ndevelop predictive diagnostics related to multi-omic tumor variates in patients receiving radiotherapy for lung\ncancer; (iii) integrate multi-tiered omic data to accurately predict the probability of local failures after lung\nradiotherapy; and (iv) identify and validate functionally significant molecular lesions in tumors that impact\nradiotherapeutic efficacy. This project is explicitly designed to utilize patient and model systems data in iterative\nand complementary testing cycles. Due to our extensive and sustained efforts in this space, we have an\nestablished preclinical understanding of the most salient genetic determinants that regulate radiation sensitivity\nin lung cancer. Altogether, our highly integrated proposal will come together in an unprecedented effort to\nadvance toward clinical integration new information and capabilities that will ultimately improve outcomes for\nthe multitude of patients receiving lung radiotherapy each year in the US and abroad.",

    "abstract_text": "Project Summary\nAlcohol-associated hepatitis (AH) is a severe, potentially life-threatening form of alcohol-associated liver\ndisease (ALD) with limited therapeutic options. Cholestasis and biliary dysfunction are common in AH\npatients and can worsen AH prognosis. Plasma membrane integrity usually determines whether a form\nof cell death is pro-inflammatory. Lytic cell death pathways can cause plasma membrane changes and\neventually lead to plasma membrane rupture (PMR), which releases intracellular contents that stimulate\nthe immune response. The role of PMR in ALD remains unknown. There is a critical need to determine\nthe role of cholestasis in promoting PMR in ALD and the therapeutic potential of targeting PMR in AH.\nThe long-term goal is to contribute toward the development of clinically useful, mechanism-based\ndiagnostic and therapeutic interventions to improve outcomes in patients with advanced ALD. The overall\nobjectives for this proposal are to 1) determine the role of PMR in ALD, and 2) investigate the\nmechanism by which cholestasis promotes hepatocellular PMR in the setting of ALD. The central\nhypothesis is that cholestasis promotes PMR in hepatocytes, thereby enhancing alcohol-associated liver\ndamage. The rationale for the proposed research is based on the identification of cholestatic injury in a\npreclinical model of AH. The overall objectives of this application will be attained by pursuing two specific\naims: (1) Determine the role of PMR in ALD; (2) Investigate the mechanism by which cholestasis\npromotes hepatocellular PMR in ALD. Under the first aim, the working hypothesis will be determined in\nmice and in vitro cell or organoid cultures with a key PMR contributor knocked down by vivo-\nmorpholinos. For the second aim, the working hypothesis will be tested in liver tissues from ALD patients\nand in in vitro cell or organoid cultures to understand the role of bile acid-mediated pathways in PMR.\nThe contribution of this proposal will be to determine the role of PMR during the progression of ALD and\nbegin to clarify the mechanisms underlying hepatocellular PMR in ALD. Upon completion of the proposed\nproject, there is the promise that a significant advance in understanding the mechanism of AH will have\nbeen made, and a mechanistic link will have been established between cholestasis and hepatocellular\nPMR in ALD. The successful completion of the proposed studies will be significant because they are\nexpected to offer novel therapeutic targets for ALD.",

    "abstract_text": "ABSTRACT\nUlcerative colitis (UC) affects nearly one million US adults. Refractory disease is still common, and the current\ntrial-and-error treatment approach causes delays in identifying optimal therapy for individual patients. Anti-TNF\nremains a commonly prescribed biologic for UC, but approximately one-third of patients fail to respond and\nabout one-third lose response over time. Understanding the role of IBD-associated genes in intestinal epithelial\ncell (IEC) injury, especially in determining therapy response or resistance, is a critical unmet need for aligning\npatients with effective treatment options. Our long-term goal is to develop cytoprotective strategies and identify\nformalin-fixed, paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue signatures that correlate with therapy response. The objective\nof this proposal is to elucidate IEC injury pathways that govern anti-TNF therapy effectiveness, and to discover\npredictive biomarkers in FFPE biopsies indicative of anti-TNF treatment outcome. Our rationale is that TNF-\ndependent and independent mechanisms of IEC injury dictate anti-TNF therapy response or resistance. Our\nnovel approach employs an innovative mouse model, A20/Abin-1T-ΔIEC, exhibiting severe colitis that mirrors\nanti-TNF refractory UC. This model is instrumental in identifying TNF-independent pathways of intestinal injury.\nComplementing this mouse model, we will apply pioneering spatial transcriptomics assays to analyze archived\nFFPE patient biopsies, revealing treatment response signatures in routinely collected samples. Predictive\nbiomarkers in FFPE biopsies would integrate best with current clinical workflows, since nearly all IBD patients\nhave archived FFPE biopsies. Additionally, we leverage well-characterized colonic organoids derived from\nhealthy controls and UC patients for mechanistic in vitro assays to characterize primary IEC responses to\ndeath stimuli.\nThe specific aims include:\n 1. Delineating TNF-independent (anti-TNF refractory) mechanisms of IEC death via the A20/Abin-1T-ΔIEC\n mouse model, hypothesizing that IL-1B signaling is a crucial driver of mucosal injury.\n 2. Validating IEC injury pathways correlated with anti-TNF treatment response and non-response in FFPE\n specimens, using a customized gene panel for detailed spatial transcriptomics.\n 3. Assessing differential sensitivities of UC-derived IEC organoids to death stimuli and cytoprotective\n factors, hypothesizing a distinct response pattern in UC-derived organoids compared to controls.\nThis proposal integrates a novel mouse model, advanced spatial transcriptomics, and patient-derived organoid\ncultures to pinpoint critical mechanisms of IEC injury and develop biomarkers indicative of anti-TNF treatment\nresponse. By advancing this research, we aim to significantly impact precision medicine for UC, aligning\nmedications to individual patient epithelial biology, while identifying new therapeutic targets.",

    "abstract_text": "Spheroids and organoids are self-assembled, multicellular, 3D structures that better mimic in vivo tissues than\n2D cell cultures. They have become an indispensable in vitro tool for processes such as drug assays, disease\nmodeling, and for mechanistic studies. The secretion of specific factors by spheroids and organoids is vital for\naccurate recapitulation of in vivo function. Methods to measure secretion from these in vitro systems are indirect,\nslow, laborious, and combine many spheroids / organoids together masking the dynamics of secretion from the\nindividuals. In this proposal, we will develop technology that will enable online measurement of secretion\ndynamics from many individual spheroids or organoids in parallel. To accomplish this work, we will perform the\nfollowing specific aims. In aim 1, a centrifugal system will be developed to deliver a continuous flow of perfusion\nsolution to spheroids / organoids as well as immunoassay assay reagents specific for the secreted factor of\ninterest. These solutions will be delivered via centrifugal pumping to a mixing channel where fluorescence\nanisotropy will be used to quantify the secreted factor as the device spins. The spinning system and fluorescence\nanisotropy system will be fully optimized. In aim 2, this system will be applied to several model spheroid systems\nfor validation of the technology. The system will enable quantitative measurement of secretory function multiple\ntimes per second from each organoid, making a significant and vertical advance compared to current technology.\nWe anticipate the new technology will be a powerful tool in the field of spheroid and organoid research.",

The rise in MUD is a growing public\nhealth concern with rates of methamphetamine-associated overdose greatly increasing, especially in\nunderserved populations, made worse by a lack of approved or implemented MUD interventions.\nMethamphetamine use is associated with a range of health concerns that can be non-abstinence treatment\ntargets but that have yet to be prospectively evaluated in clinical trials. This trial seeks to determine whether\nreduced methamphetamine use improves outcomes like cardiovascular health, immune function, sleep quality\nand other measures related to psychosocial function. We propose a randomized, controlled 12-week trial using\nincentives to reduce methamphetamine use, with an additional 12 weeks of follow up. We will randomly assign\ntreatment seeking subjects with MUD to one of two groups (1:1; n=100/group): 1) incentives for providing one\nor fewer methamphetamine positive urine samples per week in the trial, in which frequency of use is expected\nto be substantially reduced or 2) a non-contingent control group, in which frequency of use is expected to\nremain stable. We will assess improvements in selected outcomes using validated self-report items and\nobjective measures, including blood biomarkers. This research will fill a critical knowledge gap with impactful\ndata about the biomedical and psychosocial benefits of reduced methamphetamine use, which can then be\nused to advance non-abstinence outcomes as treatment indicators for MUD trials.",

    "abstract_text": "Project Summary/Abstract\n Child sexual abuse (CSA) is a significant, preventable major public health issue associated\nwith considerable adverse physical and mental health outcomes. Notably, CSA is typically\ncommitted by someone the child knows and trusts (CDC, 2024; Finkelhor & Shattuck, 2012),\nand a significant portion of sexual harm involves problematic sexual behavior (PSB) of youth\n(Gewirtz-Meydan & Finkelhor, 2020). Schools are on the frontline for preventing CSA and PSB\nof youth. Rural schools are particularly vulnerable to the impact of CSA due to health disparities,\nlow-resourced areas, and stigma (Morales et al., 2020). Consistent with recommendations of\nprevention leaders, Praesidium is a widely disseminated CSA and PSB prevention program\ndesigned to comprehensively address policies and procedures that shift the organizational\nculture to one of protection and child well-being. Program evaluations are promising, but\nrigorous evaluation has not yet been implemented. Directly teaching rules about boundaries and\nsexual behavior is critical to prevention of PSB. Both the ROAR and Stop-Go-Tell prevention\nprograms have been successfully implemented in numerous schools; report positive feedback\nfrom caregivers, students, and school personnel; and have considerable demand for the\nprogram in the state. The present study is a cluster randomized trial designed to rigorously\nexamine a comprehensive multi-layered approach to address prevention at the organization,\nprofessional, caregiver, and student levels (Praesidium with ROAR and Stop-Go-Tell integrated\nas consumer participation tools). Forty rural elementary schools that meet inclusion criteria will\nbe randomized to the intervention or waitlist control condition. Integration of consumer\n(caregiver, youth, school personnel, and partner agencies) authentic voices comprehensively\nduring the planning year and throughout the implementation and dissemination of the project is\ndesigned to enhance program and research quality, engagement, and reduce attrition. Further,\nstrategies to enhance impact and sustainability through repetition, self-analysis, and train-the-\ntrainer implementation will be tested. Qualitative methods will be utilized to examine contextual\nfactors impacting school culture, implementation fidelity, facilitators, barriers, costs, and\nunintended consequences. Oklahoma is prime to conduct this research as it builds on our\nlongstanding collaborative partnership among key leaders, investment of the state and\ncommunity in CSA and PSB prevention, and commitment to our rural communities. Results will\nhave important implications for prevention services to youth in underserved, diverse rural\ncommunities that is currently a critical gap in the CSA and PSB prevention literature.",

This project aims to approach primary\nprevention of CSA and PSB through a multilayered approach addressing school-wide policy,\nprocedures, and training to shift school-wide organizational culture to embrace responsibility of\nstudent safety from CSA and PSB and integrating direct teaching to support knowledge and\npractice of CSA and PSB prevention skills in the classroom.",

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY\n Social disconnection in humans, particularly during adolescence, is associated with substance use disorder\nvulnerability. In mice, adolescent social isolation profoundly alters reward processing in adulthood; increasing\nthe preference for drugs of abuse, enhancing associative learning, altering dopaminergic signaling and\ntranscription within the BLA and extended reward circuitry. Intriguingly, these phenomena are all also associated\nwith thyroid hormone signaling. Further, dysregulation of thyroid hormone in early life is associated lifetime risk\nfor reward-related mood disorders and altered development of monoaminergic systems. In adults, thyroid\nhormone dysregulation is associated with substance- and alcohol use disorders. Therefore, we propose that the\npersistent impacts of adolescent social isolation result from transient dysregulation of thyroid hormone signaling\nduring the sensitive period of adolescence. Thyroid hormones, when bound to their receptors, are transcription\nfactors that mediate various epigenetic processes and regulate gene expression. Aberrant thyroid hormone\nsignaling at critical developmental periods persistently alters transcription in other tissues through epigenetic\nreprogramming of thyroid hormone sensitive genes. Despite its critical role in neurodevelopment and its link to\nsubstance use disorder, the consequences of thyroid hormone dysregulation in adolescence, a key period for\nreward circuitry development and substance use disorder vulnerability, is virtually unknown. Our preliminary data\nsuggest that circulating thyroid hormones and expression of its receptors are transiently disrupted in adolescence\nby social isolation and this is associated with enhanced expression of GABAergic neuronal markers in the adult\nbasolateral amygdala (BLA), a key reward-related brain region\n Here, we will test the hypothesis that thyroid hormone is critical for development of the basolateral amygdala\n(BLA) during adolescence and that isolation-induced disruptions to the thyroid hormone system result in lasting\nepigenetic reprogramming of the reward circuitry to increase cocaine sensitivity. First, we will determine how\nadolescent social isolation impacts thyroid hormone-mediated transcription in the BLA (Aim 1). Then we will\ndetermine if thyroid hormone dysregulation induced by adolescent isolation disrupts cell-type specific\ntranscriptional profiles within the BLA (Aim 2). Finally, we will disrupt thyroid hormone receptor beta levels\nspecifically during adolescence to determine its role in reward-related behavior in (Aim 3). Together, these\nfoundational studies will establish a role for thyroid hormone-mediated programming of the BLA and uncover\nnovel mechanisms of isolation-induced reprogramming of SUD vulnerability during adolescence - an endpoint\nthat has become even more urgent given the known reductions in social interactions due to the mitigation of\nCovid-19 for the current generation of adolescents.",

Here we address\nthe urgent need to better understand the mechanisms underlying the enduring impacts of social experience on\nthe adolescent brain by investigating how social isolation dysregulation of thyroid hormone signaling during\nadolescence serves as an epigenetic switch underlying adolescent brain development and vulnerability to SUD\nwith the goal of identifying critical windows of intervention and new therapeutic targets for SUD.",

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT\nCommunity violence (CV) is a pressing public health crisis in the United States (US), disproportionately affecting\nyouth and young adults (YYA) ages 10-34. Racial and ethnic minority YYA experience a hugely disproportionate\nburden of CV, with non-Hispanic Black YYA nearly 10 times more likely to die from homicide compared to their\nnon-Hispanic white peers. Despite recognition of violence as a public health issue, many jurisdictions rely on law\nenforcement to respond to crises and conflicts among individuals and between community members. Yet the use\nof law enforcement can escalate conflicts between community members (particularly between YYA) that could\notherwise remain nonviolent, introduce risks of violence and arrest to YYA, and contribute to racial and ethnic\ndisparities in enforcement. To prevent CV while mitigating these risks, some US cities have adopted non-\nenforcement community-centered safety models (CCSMs) to use community responders to de-escalate crises\nand conflicts before violence occurs and address underlying behavioral and social drivers of CV. CCSMs—\nincluding co-response models, which send trained community responders to calls for service alongside police;\nalternative response models, which send trained community responders to calls for service without police; and\ncommunity violence interventions, though which trained community members proactively intervene in conflicts\nbefore escalation to violence—represent promising approaches to prevent CV among YYA. However, limited\nevidence exists on the effectiveness of CCSMs to prevent CV among YYA, the factors influencing the success\nor failure of CCSMs, and how CCSM modalities impact CV across diverse communities. This study will fill that\ngap. Aim 1 will use an implementation science approach to characterize CCSM operations in 15 US jurisdictions,\ndocumenting program characteristics, funding mechanisms, and scope to facilitate impact evaluation. Aim 2 will\nuse an augmented synthetic control approach to estimate the overall and modality-specific impacts of CCSMs\non a range of CV outcomes among YYA. Aim 3 will use feature importance analysis with Bayesian additive\nregression trees to explore which CCSM operational factors drive strong or weak estimates of CCSM\neffectiveness. This innovative research is directly responsive to the CDC’s Violence Prevention Research Priority\nto evaluate the effectiveness of community-level change strategies to reduce multiple forms of violence. This\nresearch is directly responsive to Research Objective 1 of the current NOFO through its focus on the evaluation\nof an innovative but understudied intervention to prevent CV with the potential for immediate benefit after\nimplementation. In sum, by generating critical evidence about CCSMs, this project has the potential to reduce\nCV among YYA, inform policymakers as they design and deploy CCSMs in local jurisdictions, and promote health\nequity through innovative, evidence-based prevention strategies. The multidisciplinary investigator team will work\nwith a Community Advisory Board to maximize the impact and reach of the research.",

    "abstract_text": "ABSTRACT\nUnderstanding and mitigating drug-induced liver injury (DILI) in children is crucial for pediatric healthcare.\nChildren are more prone to liver damage due to differences in drug metabolism, liver development, and unique\nsusceptibilities. DILI can cause immediate health risks and long-term issues like liver failure or chronic liver\ndisease. Since children often need medications for chronic diseases such as epilepsy, infections, and pain,\nensuring the safety of drugs is vital. Addressing DILI in children through advanced methods not only improves\ndrug safety but also supports personalized medicine, enhancing care quality and reducing adverse drug\nreactions. For example, acetaminophen, commonly used for pain and fever, can cause severe liver damage.\nValproic acid, used for epilepsy, also poses a risk of liver toxicity, especially with long-term use. In this\nproposal, we would like to investigate mechanisms of toxicity of acetaminophen, valproic acid, amoxicillin-\nclavulanate, cannabidiol (CBD), and isoniazid, which covers critical pharmaceuticals in pediatric healthcare,\nand develop biomarkers of pediatric DILI caused by these pharmaceuticals. The proposal has two main aims.\nAim 1 is to evaluate the effect of selected drugs on liver toxicity markers using a sandwich cultured human\nhepatocyte model leveraging primary human hepatocytes from pediatric and adult donors. This will involve\nmeasuring proteomic and metabolomic biomarkers in drug-treated hepatocyte lots from infants, children,\nadolescents, and adults to understand age-specific mechanisms of DILI. The study will also analyze\nproteomics data of extracellular vesicles and untargeted metabolomics of media to identify molecular changes\nand drug-protein adducts. These data will be integrated into mathematical models using quantitative systems\ntoxicology (QST) models to predict pathways and mechanisms of DILI. Aim 2 will measure the effects of acute\nand prolonged drug exposure using liver microphysiological system (MPS) using standardized liver tissue chip.\nBy analyzing proteins and metabolites released in the media from these systems, the study will assess\nimmediate and long-term impacts on liver function and toxicity in both pediatric and adult livers. Overall,\nutilizing advanced methodologies such as proteomics, metabolomics, and complex in vitro models, including\nMPS, the research will assess DILI across various pediatric age groups. Integrating these findings into\nmathematical models will provide a deeper understanding of DILI mechanisms and potentially identify specific\nbiomarkers relevant to children. Ultimately, when validated in clinic, pediatric DILI candidate biomarkers will\nenhance drug safety profiles, inform better prescribing practices, and support personalized treatment\napproaches in children.",
    "project_title": "Predictive approaches to mitigate risk of hepatotoxicity of drugs in children",
    "phr_text": "Narrative\nThe overarching goal for this research is to make medications safer for children by studying how common\ndrugs like acetaminophen and valproic acid can harm young livers. By understanding how liver cells from\ndifferent age groups respond to these drugs, drug developers and doctors can predict liver damage early.\nUltimately, this will lead to safer prescribing practices, better health outcomes for kids, and lower healthcare\ncosts.",

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY\n Chronic neurological impairments are a widespread consequence of both the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic\nand the subsequent surge in RSV that will place a lasting burden on healthcare systems worldwide. This\nincludes both purely cognitive symptoms (sleep disruption, confusion, and brain fog) as well as symptoms of\nperipheral and autonomic neuropathy (shortness of breath, intractable cough, headache, and stroke). While\nthe blood-brain barrier protects central nervous system (CNS), the peripheral nervous system (PNS) is more\ndirectly exposed to pathogens both in the nerve terminals innervating the upper respiratory tract and through\nthe general circulation. Unfortunately, viral invasion of the PNS is vastly understudied despite its constant\nexposure to pathogens and critical role in the regulation of normal bodily functions.\n Using innovative neural microphysiological systems (MPSs), we have recently demonstrated that RSV\ninfects both monocytes and neurons in peripheral nerve tissue, generates concerted chemokine release, and\ndose-dependently induces nerve hypersensitization or progressive neurotoxicity. Both neuronal infection and\ninflammation-mediated neuropathy are novel observations that could explain analogous mechanisms of\nperipheral neuroinvasion in humans that may contribute to sudden apnea experienced by infants exposed to\nRSV in utero, chronic airway hyperreactivity in children exposed to RSV in the perinatal period, and the\npersistent peripheral neuropathy and autonomic dysfunction associated with long COVID. Critically, MPSs\nsupport the use of rodent, human stem cell-derived, or primary cell types within the same model system,\nfacilitating comparison of analogous data across species towards translation of basic research findings to the\nclinic.\n The development of bioengineered models of the PNS and likewise the methodologies necessary for\nefficient, repeatable data extraction specifically from microphysiological peripheral nerve has received\nconsiderably less attention than analogous models of the CNS. Here we propose to establish the conditions\nnecessary to facilitate interaction between peripheral neurons, glia, and inflammatory cells in\nmicrophysiological culture to advance the meaningful complexity of microphysiological PNS modeling. We\nalso aim to identify the most stable and sensitive optogenetic tools for long-term longitudinal collection of\nneurophysiological data to maximize the utility of this MPS for detection of viral neuropathy. We will then\ndemonstrate the utility of the system by using it to compare peripheral neuropathy resulting from direct\nexposure to RSV and SARS-CoV-2. Completion of these goals will establish the feasibility of a novel, human-\nbased MPS capable of elucidating peripheral neurotropism of known and emerging viruses.",

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nSjögren’s disease (SjD), a systemic autoimmune disease that affects four million people in the United States and\nimpairs health-related quality of life, has no FDA approved disease modifying treatments available. SjD is highly\nheterogeneous and has multiple endotypes or pathobiologically similar subgroups. The standard for studying\ncomplex cell interactions and organ systems in SjD is mouse model work. Unfortunately mice fail to fully\nencapsulate all features of SjD and also are homogeneous. Thus, a system is needed that can recapitulate both\nthe complex interactions in vivo but also the heterogeneity of SjD. Our long-term goal is to leverage\nmicrophysiological systems (MPSs) to test SjD therapeutics. The goal of this project is to capture the functional\neffects of a fibrotic microenvironment in SjD progression. The hypothesis of this project is that MPSs\nincorporating collagen density and fibroblasts will more faithfully reproduce in vivo epithelial cell and lymphocyte\nphenotype and transcriptome, ensuring our MPS is more physiologically relevant for future therapeutic testing.\nThe rationale for this hypothesis is based on the fact that in mice, fibroblasts are necessary for germinal center\nformation in salivary glands and that fibroblasts under inflammatory conditions promote CXCR3+ CD4+ T-cell\nchemotaxis. Furthermore, SjD patients have more fibrosis of salivary glands than non-SjD patients, independent\nof age. In other diseases, fibrosis and collagen density affect lymphocyte chemotaxis. Yet, the effects of collagen\ndensity and fibroblasts remain unclear in SjD. The central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing two specific\naims. Aim 1 will interrogate collagen density effects on SG-organoids and lymphocyte extravasation and\nchemotaxis. MPSs will be generated with various collagen densities. Lymphocyte chemotaxis to salivary gland\norganoids will be evaluated with and without the presence of fibroblasts. Aim 2 will compare MPSs to in vivo SjD\nmodels, using pharmacologic probes. We will contrast the effect of JAK inhibitors on lymphocyte chemotaxis as\nwell as on peripheral blood mononuclear cells, fibroblast, and organoid cell signatures in our MPS as well as in\na relevant mouse model. This project builds an interdisciplinary team with unique expertise in SjD and salivary\ngland biology, MPS experts, and experts in seqFISH and hybridization chain reaction. The proposed application\nis innovative because it uses cutting edge MPSs and approaches to measure spatial genomics and proteomics\nof the MPSs. It also defines the effect of collagen density on the local immune environment. This research is\nsignificant because it will improve novel therapeutics screening and selection, leveraging a complex system\nthat recapitulates SjD. Furthermore, this MPS is capable of recreating specific SjD endotypes to tailor research\nto SjD heterogeneity.",

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nVaccines play an essential role in controlling and preventing infectious diseases in humans. The efficacy of\nvaccine depends on the extent to which the vaccine enhances the adaptive immune response in the body,\nwhich remembers and eliminates the foreign invader. However, the lack of reliable preclinical model for human\nadaptive immunity modeling and vaccine assessment have frequently led to vaccine products failing in clinical\ntrials. Interspecies differences between current animal models and humans hinder accurate replication of\nhuman immune responses for vaccine assessment. Adaptive immune response to vaccine is mainly initiated in\nlymph nodes (LNs), which serve as vital hubs for various types of adaptive immune-related lymphocytes. LNs\nare highly structured secondary lymphoid organs with essential functions reliant on the unique spatial\narrangement of lymphocytes and stromal cells as well as chemokines that drive the signaling cascades\nunderlying the adaptive immune response. After vaccination, vaccines drain to the LNs, where antigen-\npresenting cells recognize and phagocytize vaccine antigens to induce T cell and naïve B cell activation and\ndifferentiation for antibody secretion that sustain long-term immune responses. Changes in the LN niche such\nas depletion of CD4+ T cells, reduced germinal centers, and LN extracellular matrix (ECM) fibrosis due to\ngenetic variation, disease, aging, or chronic inflammation can lead to delayed immune responses affecting\nvaccine efficacy across populations. Developing models of LNs that accurately replicate their intact immune\nniche, describing the dynamics and organization of LNs, is a significant challenge in human adaptive immunity\nresearch. To date, no reliable in vitro model of LNs has been able to simulate the complete dynamic process of\nadaptive immunity for vaccine assessment. In this work we aim to develop a human “Lymph node-on-a-Chip”\nmicrophysiological system with microanatomic organization of key functional compartments (paracortex,\nfollicle, subcapsular sinus, lymphatic and blood vessels) with full spectrum of LN cell types (dendritic cells, T\ncells, B cells, fibroblasts) and continuous lymph fluid perfusion to replicate the in vivo physiology of human LN\nmicroenvironment. These underscores the pressing importance of devising more clinically relevant vaccine\ntesting models. The human Lymph node-on-a-Chip will serve as a unique precision medicine platform that\nprovides a more accurate representation of adaptive immune responses than traditional animal models for\nvaccine effectiveness evaluation. This technology with a novel “clinical trials on a chip” protocol allows an\naccurate assessment of vaccines and adjuvants against emerging infectious diseases, thus aids in optimizing\nvaccination strategies for optimal protection for different populations.",

    "phr_text": "PROJECT NARRATIVE\nLymph nodes play a pivotal role in human adaptive immune responses that are vital for vaccine efficacy. The\nlack of reliable preclinical model for human adaptive immunity modeling and vaccine assessment have frequently\nled to vaccine products failing in clinical trials. This research will develop a microfluidics-based human “Lymph\nnode-on a Chip” microphysiological system to replicate the in vivo physiology of human lymph node\nmicroenvironment, and demonstrate a new paradigm for “clinical trials on a chip” study to facilitate vaccine\nevaluation, screening, and new vaccination strategy development for infectious diseases.",

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nObstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is known to be correlated with cardiovascular diseases (CVD), yet controlled\nclinical trials showed that CPAP treatment was insufficient to alleviate CVD risk in all patients. Current tools fail\nto identify the mechanistic pathways involved in OSA-related CVD pathophysiology, and residual CVD risk may\npersist despite CPAP treatment. Conversely, some studies have identified OSA as possibly protective against\nmyocardial infarction consequences, highlighting significant knowledge gaps in understanding the mechanisms\nlinking OSA and CVD. This research project aims to elucidate the complex relationship between OSA and CVD\nthrough an innovative \"bed to bench\" approach, integrating clinical, in silico, and in vitro techniques. Specifically,\nwe will develop and validate a novel mathematical model to quantify tissue-specific hypoxia burden in OSA\npatients, correlating this with clinical outcomes and traditional OSA metrics. This model will be validated using\nsuperoxide expression in microvascular tissue from patient skin biopsies and further refined with large-scale\nsleep study databases from the Sleep Heart Health Study (SHHS). Second, we will optimize in vitro\nmicrovascular models, including an endothelial cell model and an advanced Vascularized Micro-Organ (VMO)\nplatform, to study the direct effects of intermittent hypoxia (IH) on the microvasculature. The IH protocol will be\ndeveloped to match gene expression profiles of IH-exposed endothelial cells to patient biopsy profiles to ensure\nphysiological relevance. Third, we will employ a \"heart-on-a-chip\" model to investigate the direct impact of OSA-\ninduced IH on cardiac structure and function, providing insights into OSA-specific cardiovascular pathways.\nThroughout these aims, we will leverage data from the National Sleep Research Resource to inform our models\nand validate our findings against real-world patient outcomes. This comprehensive approach addresses current\nlimitations in OSA research by providing more accurate risk assessment tools and physiologically relevant in\nvitro models. Our strategy has the potential to uncover new biomarkers, identify novel therapeutic targets, and\nultimately improve the clinical management of OSA patients at risk for cardiovascular complications.",

Sadly, an average of 22 people die each day due to lack of available life-saving organ,\nwith the numbers expected to increase every year. The same is true for patients on liver transplantation waitlist.\nIn the United States, there are an average of 12,000 patients waiting for a liver transplantation at any given\ntime. The ability to generate exogenous organs in pig for transplantation into humans (xenotransplantation) is\nconsidered as one of the sources to bridge this shortfall. Pigs are already being used for xenotransplantation\nstudies as the size of the animal, organs and physiology are similar to humans. Several tissues from pigs (heart\nvalves, bladder, cornea, etc) are already being used or in advanced stages of product development for\ntransplantation into humans. The main goal of our Company is to generate human liver from donor patient-\nspecific cells using pig as a bio-incubator. Following technical validation, this will provide a pathway for\ngenerating an “on-demand” source of transplantation ready hepatocytes for cellular therapies and will plug-in\ninto the associated technologies such as organ-on- chips, 3D- printing, and pharmaceutical applications in the\nshort-term. In the long-term, the goal is to generate immune-compatible transplantation ready solid organs for\ntransplantation.",

    "abstract_text": "ABSTRACT\nScleroderma (SSc) is a multisystem disease characterized by cutaneous and visceral fibrosis that most\ncommonly affects the lung. Nearly 70% of patients with SSc experience clinically significant interstitial lung\ndisease (SSc-ILD) that in 50% will lead to death within ten years of diagnosis. For unknown reasons, women are\nmore commonly affected, yet men have worse clinical outcomes. Defining the molecular mechanisms of SSc-\nILD sex differences may eradicate these disparities and improve patient care. SSc-ILD is believed to result from\nimmune-driven accumulation of transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ)-1 responsive, extracellular matrix\n(ECM)-producing inflammatory fibroblasts. Innate immune pattern recognition receptors and their endogenous\nligands are implicated in this process. The endosomal innate immune receptor Toll-Like Receptor 9 (TLR9),\nwhich recognizes and responds to danger associated molecular patterns such as mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA),\nhas a recently discovered role in SSc-ILD. We found that SSc-ILD fibroblasts exhibit spontaneous mtDNA\nrelease and TLR9 activation. Extracellular mtDNA concentrations are increased in SSc-ILD bronchoalveolar\nlavage and plasma where they predict disease progression. Relative to their male counterparts, women with\nSSc-ILD show plasma mtDNA that is more bioactive and lung explants that are enriched for TLR9-responsive\ninflammatory genes. In chronic SSc-ILD mouse models, females show greater mtDNA bioactivity, TLR9\nactivation, and a stronger therapeutic response to pharmacologic TLR9 inhibition. The heightened inflammation-\npromoting consequences of mtDNA-TLR9 interaction in women could explain sex differences in clinical\nphenotypes experienced by SSc-ILD patients. Our world class team of experts will test the hypothesis that\ndifferential interactions between extracellular mtDNA and TLR9 drive SSc-ILD sexual dimorphism. Aim 1 will\nadvance the study of extracellular mtDNA, TLR9, and SSc-ILD sex differences by a) characterizing extracellular\nmtDNA and TLR9 activation in SSc-ILD BAL samples from women and men; and b) using single nuclear\nsequencing and protein-based assays to compare TLR9 expression/activation in archived, explanted lung tissue\nspecimens from women and men with SSc-ILD. Aim 2 will define mechanisms of sexual dimorphism in the\nextracellular mtDNA-TLR9 relationship in experimental mouse models of chronic lung fibrosis using a)\npharmacologic and b) genomic methods in a tamoxifen-inducible model of fibroblast-specific Tlr9 deletion and\ntwo chronic models of SSc lung fibrosis. Aim 3 will probe sex differences in fibrogenic extracellular mtDNA-TLR9\ninteractions in human lung fibrosis using genetic and pharmacologic strategies in primary lung fibroblasts and a\nnext generation model of lung fibrosis based on TGFβ1-stimulated human lung cores. If successful, these\nstudies will frame extracellular mtDNA-TLR9 interactions as drivers of SSc-ILD sexual dimorphism and identify\nmechanisms that can be leveraged for the betterment of human health.",

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT\nImmune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are an important advancement in oncology and have restored anti-tumor\nimmune responses, resulting in improved survival in many cancer types. Nevertheless, there is emerging\nevidence that ICIs are associated with cardiovascular toxicities, including myocarditis, which has mortality rates\nas high as 50% in fulminant cases. Additionally, ICIs are associated with excess atherosclerotic events, such as\nmyocardial infarction, stroke, and peripheral artery disease. Apart from toxicities associated with ICIs, there is a\nsmall group of patients who are non-responders to ICIs; many recent studies suggest that ICIs may induce\nvarious forms of immune dysregulation, which may paradoxically accelerate cardiovascular disease (CVD).\nImmune dysregulation is largely defined by increased oxidative stress, accumulation of reactive oxygen species\n(ROS), and immune cell senescence. Senescent immune cells demonstrate limited surveillance of immune\nresponses, but also become pro-inflammatory due to a permanent change in gene expression profile termed a\nsenescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), that can induce chronic inflammation, tissue damage,\nresist immunotherapy, and progress CVD. Based on these observations, we hypothesize that immuno-\nsenescence is a central linking mechanism of ICI-associated cardiovascular disease (ICI-CVD) and ultimately\nlength of survival in cancer patients. Importantly, our preliminary work suggests that immuno-senescence that\npreexisted prior to treatment, rather than toxicity that developed during treatment, drives cardiovascular risk and\nnegatively impacts cancer treatment effect. For example, we found that metabolomic measures and epigenetics\nprior to ICI treatment predicts the development of cardiovascular events of post-ICI treatment, highlighting the\nvalue of evaluating baseline immune health prior to treatment. In order to address this clinical question, our\nproject is a paradigm shift by combining clinical data with multi-omics biosample-derived biomarkers before and\nafter ICI treatment, such as metabolomics, aging through epigenetic markers, and clonal hematopoiesis of\nindeterminate potential (CHIP), to develop predictive models that differentiate patients according to their\nestimated risk of ICI-CVD and cancer mortality. This systems-level approach utilizes three aims: (1) discouple\nthe biological predictors of cardiovascular toxicity from ICI efficacy; (2) identify metabolite patterns of human\nmonocyte-derived macrophages (HMDMs) that are associated with cardiovascular and oncologic outcomes; and\n(3) identify genetic and epigenetic determinants, including CHIP, of cardiovascular risk and cancer prognosis in\npatients receiving ICI therapy. Using this integrated strategy we aim to address clinical management by providing\nbiomarkers that predict both subsequent cardiovascular event incidence and poor cancer outcomes. Our findings\nmay help us determine new therapeutic interventions that separate the anti-tumor benefit of ICI from their\ncardiovascular risks. Moreover, we will be able to refine diagnostic criteria, and develop a grading scale for ICI-\nCVD that may help improve clinical decision-making in relation to continuing treatment, and ultimately improve\nsurvival, and quality of life for cancer patients receiving immunotherapy.",

    "abstract_text": "ABSTRACT\nThis proposal by Kuria Therapeutics seeks to conduct IND-enabling studies of KTX-1161, a topical eye drop\nintended to protect corneal endothelial cells (CECs) during cataract surgery and to treat Fuchs’ endothelial\ncorneal dystrophy. KTX-1161 contains the active ingredient SCO-116 which is a proprietary small molecule that\nactivates NRF2. NRF2 is a transcription factor that initiates protective cellular defense systems against oxidative\nstress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and inflammation. The KTX-1161 eye drop should act to protect against the\noxidative insult from phacoemulsification and the chronic oxidative stress inherent to Fuchs’ dystrophy.\nThree Specific Aims in this proposal will achieve the overall goal of completing the IND-enabling nonclinical\nrequirements in preparation for first clinical studies of KTX-1161. In Phase I, Aim 1 is to conduct the GLP\ngenotoxicity study package typically required by FDA for small molecules. Studies include the Ames test, in vitro\nchromosome aberration assay, and an in vivo micronucleus test in rats to determine the genetic toxicity potential\nof SCO-116. In Phase II, Aim 2 includes conduct of the FDA-required GLP safety pharmacology program, an\nocular pharmacokinetic study, and the typical GLP oral and ocular toxicology studies. For safety pharmacology,\na rat respiratory study and hERG test will be performed. A rabbit ocular PK study was specifically requested by\nFDA and will be done. The rat oral and dog ocular toxicology studies will be the normal 28-day toxicology designs\nwith the addition of detailed observations to the rat oral study as requested by FDA during a 2023 pre-IND\nmeeting. Aim 3 comprises the writing of the nonclinical section of the IND which will include the nonclinical study\nreports supporting SCO-116 safety and efficacy and the written and tabulated summaries.\nCEC loss occurs in virtually all of the ~4 million cataract surgeries done each year in the US, with about half a\nmillion patients experiencing excessive CEC loss. With KTX-1161, Kuria aspires to reduce the number of\nexcessive CEC losses and reduce the magnitude of average CEC loss, protecting the future vision of all patients.",

    "abstract_text": "Dry Eye Disease (DED) affects 20% of the global adult population, with higher rates in developed countries like\nthe USA. It significantly impacts quality of life, productivity, increases healthcare costs, and can lead to vision\nloss if untreated. Current therapies are incapable of addressing chronic DED as they cannot be used long-term\ndue to their toxicity. Our innovative First-In-Class mitochondrial technology targets the root cause of DED by\naddressing oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction, which induces Meibomian Gland Dysfunction (MGD),\na predominant cause of DED. Due to its unique mechanism of action, our drug candidate is safe for long-term\nuse and offers a broader therapeutic window. This noninvasive treatment promises to revolutionize eye care and\nprovide a sustainable solution to this widespread health challenge.\nOur proprietary small molecule lead candidate exhibits dose dependent free radical scavenging potential with\ncalculated IC50 of 2.1µM and was found to protect various ocular cell lines against oxidative stress. It was found\nto be highly efficacious in reducing Benzalkonium chloride induced dry eye, tissue damage and vascularization\nin mice model of dry eye. An ophthalmic safety study suggests that an acute TID dose of our candidate as eye\ndrops up to 30 µg/eye (total dose of 90 µg/eye/day) was well tolerated in New Zealand White rabbits.\nWe have secured our invention by the filing of patent applications in the USA (US2021163159081), China\n(CN2280008594), India (IN202317001652), Canada (CA3205099A1), EU (EP22767950.3), Brazil (BR\n1120230181097), Australia (AUS 2022234307) and Japan (JP2023-555226) for compounds, compositions, and\ntheir method of use. The novelty of our invention is confirmed by a written opinion from USPTO and an enhanced\nfreedom to operate searches by qualified patent attorneys.\nDED is a multifactorial indication; therefore, in proposed SBIR phase I, our proposed studies entail In vivo\ncharacterization of lead candidates in desiccating stress/scopolamine (DSS) model of DED in mice working\nthrough varied etiologies. We also propose to evaluate the toxicity of our lead in repeated dose 7-day rabbit\nmodel of toxicity with PK parameters and local biodistribution in eye tissues of rabbits. Successful completion of\nproposed studies will be followed by submission of a phase-II SBIR to conduct a set of IND-enabling pre-clinical\nstudies, manufacturing process scaleup and development, and analytical method validation, GLP toxicity studies\nwith recovery group. Setup of in-house eCTD software interface and electronic submission gateway (ESG) with\nFDA and relevant certifications of personnel and workstation infrastructure will also be included in the SBIR\nphase-II application. We have assembled an experienced team consisting of chemists, drug discovery and bench\nto bedside drug product development experts, pharmacologists, ocular pharmacokinetics, toxicologists,\nophthalmologists, regulatory experts, and industry partners. We are confident of successfully completing the\nproposed work.",

    "abstract_text": "Wildfires have become more frequent and intense over the last four decades. Due to the burning of both biomass and human-made structures during wildfires, the particulate matter generated from wildfire smoke (WFPM) tends to have smaller particle sizes and contain a unique mixture of chemicals that may be more toxic than urban background PM2.5, which is mostly generated from the fossil fuel combustion. Of particular concern is the presence of more polar and higher oxidative organic compounds, such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), which could lead to a host of adverse consequences including effects on human fertility. As wildfires become more pervasive, it is imperative to understand how they affect female reproductive function. To address this knowledge gap, we propose to develop a transdisciplinary consortium to explore a set of integrated aims using population, clinical, and experimental approaches to investigate the association between wildfire smoke and female fertility. Aim 1 will utilize population-level data from the National Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) Surveillance System, which includes over 220,000 ART cycles initiated in Western US states from 2001 to 2019, to evaluate the impact of WFPM on probability of cycle cancellation, clinical pregnancy, and live birth. Aim 2 will leverage a unique clinical biorepository of ART patients at UCSF who underwent oocyte retrieval during a period of pristine air quality (May-Jul 2020) and record-setting wildfires (Sep-Nov 2020) to determine the impacts of WFPM on ovarian reserve, oocyte and embryo quality, and the chemical composition of the follicular fluid. Finally, Aim 3 will use a state-of-the-art, lab-based wildfire simulator to experimentally evaluate the effects of whole-body WFPM on ovarian function and reproductive outcomes in mice. Moreover, an established ex vivo 3D ovarian follicle culture system will be used to investigate the toxic mechanisms of human relevant exposure levels of WFPM on folliculogenesis and oogenesis. We expect the clinical and biological insights gained from this proposal will provide valuable information for individual- and population-level prevention, clinical decision making, future risk assessments and policy decisions, with the longer-term goal of reducing female infertility.",

    "abstract_text": "Abstract\nShasqi, Inc. is utilizing its innovative Click Activated Protodrugs Against Cancer (CAPAC®) platform to improve\nthe therapeutic efficacy of cancer treatments by facilitating precise and localized activation of potent cytotoxic\ndrugs. Many standard-of-care therapies lack tumor specificity and often require high doses to achieve a\ntherapeutic benefit, which result in significant toxicity and adverse drug events (ADEs). Similarly, antibody-drug\nconjugates (ADCs), while designed as targeted therapeutics, deliver less than 2% of the active drug to the tumor\nsite. A much larger fraction of the dose is distributed to and degraded in healthy tissues, resulting in off-target\ntoxicities, limiting the therapeutic index. Shasqi’s CAPAC platform overcomes these challenges by using\nbioorthogonal click chemistry to activate drugs precisely at the tumor site. The platform is made up of a two-\ncomponent system: a tetrazine-modified antigen-targeting conjugate and a trans-cyclooctene-modified prodrug\n(a.k.a. protodrug). The first component, the tetrazine conjugate, is designed to bind specifically to tumor-\nassociated antigens, such as CEACAM5, and is otherwise inert until paired with the second component. The\nsecond component, the protodrug, is inactive until it encounters the tetrazine conjugate at the tumor site. Upon\nmeeting, a highly specific and rapid chemical reaction occurs between the two components, releasing the active\ndrug only in the localized area of the tumor, maximizing efficacy and reducing systemic toxicity. This Direct-to-\nPhase II project targets CEACAM5, which is an antigen whose expression has been well established in several\ncancers with significant unmet need. CEACAM5 has been found in over 90% of colorectal, gastric and pancreatic\ncancer cases, and in 25% of non-small-cell lung cancers (NSCLC) cases. CEACAM5 is ideal for localized drug\nactivation, not just because of its slow internalization kinetics, but also due to its high tumor specificity and\nminimal expression in normal tissues. By optimizing CEACAM5-targeted activating agents and conducting\npreclinical studies focused on pharmacokinetics, efficacy and tolerability, this project aims to develop a novel\nplatform for targeted drug delivery. The specific aims of this projects are: 1) Develop and characterize\nCEACAM5-targeted activating agent conjugates, 2) Evaluate pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic\n(PK/PD) properties of preferred conjugates, 3) Demonstrate antitumor efficacy of CEACAM5-binders with\nMMAE protodrug in multiple murine tumor models of lung carcinoma and 4) Perform a non-GLP\ntoxicology study in naïve rats. Aside from cancer therapy, the CAPAC platform also has the potential for\nadoption by other therapeutic areas, such as infectious diseases and autoimmune disorders, since it offers\nimproved therapeutic outcomes with minimal toxicity.",

    "abstract_text": "Project Abstract\nIn the U.S., about 850,000 vertebral compression fracture cases are reported annually, with Medicare-related\nexpenses estimated at $250 million. These fractures are particularly common in individuals with osteoporosis\nand have a significant impact on the aging population. Compression fractures affect 20% of those over the age\nof 70. Traditionally, these fractures are conservatively treated with pain management or surgically treated with\nminimally invasive vertebral augmentation procedures involving the injection of polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA)\ninto the vertebrae. Vertebral augmentation has shown benefits in vertebral stabilization, leading to significant\npain relief and improved quality of life in up to 90% of treated patients.\nHowever, the use of PMMA in spinal surgeries has raised concerns due to its potential short-term and long-term\ncomplications. These include thermal necrosis of adjacent bone tissue, risk of fractures in adjacent vertebrae,\nand difficulties in revision surgeries due to PMMA's stiffness and lack of biodegradability. Most notably, cement\nleakage, or extravasation, has been reported in up to 75% of cases, leading to serious complications like\npulmonary embolisms in up to 23% of patients. Consequently, the prevalence of these procedures has\ndecreased by more than 70% since the emergence of these risks, leading to a decline in surgical interventions\nfor osteoporotic spine fractures after 2009. This situation underscores the need for safer, more effective\ntreatments for spinal fractures in vulnerable populations.\nTo address this problem, RevBio has developed Tetranite® (TN), a novel mineral-organic bone adhesive that\ncan fill gaps in bone, bond bone fragments together, adhere metal to bone, and accelerate healing through its\nosteoconductive effects. TN’s proven percutaneous injectability, low exothermal temperature, biodegradability,\nintrinsic mechanical strength, regenerative capabilities, and lack of toxicity make it a good candidate for replacing\nPMMA to treat elderly patients with vertebral fractures. There is no other material on the market to address unmet\nneeds in the orthopaedic space of vertebral fractures for the aging U.S. population.\nThe results from the summative user handling cadaver study (Aim 1) and the pivotal large animal study (Aim 2)\nwill be submitted to FDA in an IDE application to initiate clinical studies. Long term, RevBio's mission is to\ncommercialize TN to revolutionize approaches to minimally invasive spinal care, especially for aging patients\nwith osteoporosis or poor bone quality. We aim to offer surgeons and patients a safer, more effective alternative\ntreatment that is designed to reduce pain, accelerate return to function, and significantly decrease the\ncomplication rates associated with current vertebral fracture procedures.",

    "phr_text": "Project Narrative\nVertebral compression fractures are one of the most common types of painful fractures in the elderly with\napproximately 850,000 cases reported annually in the U.S and 20% of the occurrences in people aged 70 years\nor older.

This\nproject will demonstrate that Tetranite®—a novel bone adhesive that can be administered percutaneously using\nimage-guidance during surgery—can be used in a safe and effective manner to treat vertebral compression\nfractures using minimally invasive approaches in a large animal model and a surgeon-led human cadaver\nbiomechanical study to ultimately gain regulatory approval as a commercial product.",

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nCancer is the second leading cause of death in the United States with metastatic cancers accounting for 70-90%\nof all cancer fatalities. Lung cancer represents the most prevalent cancer type as well as the deadliest,\naccounting for approximately 20% of all cancer-related deaths. Despite recent advances in novel molecularly\ntargeted therapeutic modalities, including antibody-drug conjugates, cell therapies, and immune checkpoint\ninhibitors, many lung cancer patients fail to benefit from these treatments and urgently require new therapeutic\noptions, particularly for addressing disseminated metastatic disease. In contrast to targeting cell surface antigens\non tumor cells or other cell types, Matrisome Bio is developing targeted therapeutics specific for disease-related\ncomponents of the extracellular matrix (ECM), circumventing the need to reach tumor cells to facilitate drug\ndelivery and internalization. Some ECM targets present advantages over cellular targets due to the ECM’s high\nabundance, its expression across various cancer types and stages of disease, including both early and advanced\ntumors, and its slow turnover, which enables extended retention of ECM-targeted therapeutics at disease sites.\nResearch conducted prior to the founding of Matrisome Bio identified several proteins preferentially expressed\nin the ECM of lung tumors and metastases. Matrisome Bio is developing molecularly targeted drugs based on a\nsuite of nanobodies that specifically target disease-associated ECM proteins that are highly expressed in lung\ncancer and other cancer indications and minimally expressed in normal healthy organs. Published research from\nMatrisome Bio’s founders demonstrates that ECM-specific nanobodies can effectively deliver various payloads\nin mouse models of solid tumors and metastatic disease. The efforts outlined in this grant aim to build upon these\nstudies by developing a theranostic radiopharmaceutical targeted to an ECM component that we have identified,\nwhich is expressed in over 90% of lung tumors and metastases, and which we believe holds the potential to\ntransform the treatment of advanced lung cancer. This Direct to Phase II SBIR application aims to (1) develop\nrefined binder molecules facilitating optimized biodistribution and tumor uptake behavior, characterize target\nbinding kinetics, and optimize preclinical-scale radiolabeling formulations; (2) characterize in vivo biodistribution\nand clearance kinetics of select binders and determine tolerability in a dose escalation study in preclinical models\nof lung cancer; and (3) evaluate preclinical efficacy, safety, and toxicity of lead binder molecules as well as\nconduct a pre-IND meeting with FDA. This project aims to demonstrate the feasibility of developing and\noptimizing ECM-targeting theranostic radiopharmaceuticals with characteristics suitable for effective use in the\ndiagnosis and treatment of advanced lung cancer in humans.",

    "phr_text": "PROJECT NARRATIVE\nLung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths, with the majority of patients failing to respond\nadequately to currently available therapies and most often succumbing to metastatic disease within a few years\nof diagnosis. To address this major unmet clinical need, Matrisome Bio is developing innovative theranostic\nradiopharmaceuticals that target disease-specific components of the extracellular matrix surrounding tumor cells,\nand which are broadly expressed in primary tumors and metastases of lung cancer patients. This approach\nleverages a previously underexplored opportunity for targeted cancer therapies that can be applied for both\nimaging and therapy of advanced lung cancers to bring novel and efficacious treatments to patients.",

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nThe most deadly type of heart attack, ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI)\ninvolves blockage of the coronary artery and affects approximately 750,000 people annually in\nthe US. While percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) saves lives by restoring blood flow to the\nischemic heart, as much as half of the long-term damage to the heart is due to the reperfusion\ninjury, for which there is no approved therapeutic shown to significantly reduce resulting cardiac\ninfarct size. Larger infarcts are strongly associated with reinfarction, hospitalization with heart\nfailure, and all-cause mortality. In the proposed Phase I SBIR Small Business Transition grant,\nLaborecom Therapeutics Inc. is developing a novel therapeutic peptide to reduce reperfusion\ninjury. While other therapeutics have attempted to reduce reperfusion injury by direct immune\nsuppression or reduction in mitochondrial stress, this approach targets a motor protein uniquely\nexpressed in endothelial cells to prevent transendothelial migration. In aim 1, the therapeutic\npeptide will be optimized for stability, permeability, and plasma protein binding while maintaining\ntherapeutic activity as measured by in vitro transendothelial migration assay. In aim 2, optimized\npeptides will be tested head-to-head in a mouse model of myocardial infarction for their ability to\nimpact heart function as measured by echocardiogram and limit infarct size as measured by\nhistopathology. The successful completion of these aims will result in an optimized lead candidate\nfor further development through a Phase II award including IND-enabling studies and testing in a\nswine model of myocardial infarction. In addition to scientific research, under this transition award\nLaborecom Therapeutics will support the career development of Dr. Lucas Shores through a\ntailored career development plan. This will include entrepreneurial training through local and\nnational programs, as well as direct mentorship from serial entrepreneurs and current executives\nat biotechnology companies to facilitate his transition to a career as an entrepreneur and\nindependent investigator.",

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT\nCushing’s disease (CD) is a serious endocrine disorder characterized by an adrenocorticotropic hormone\n(ACTH)-secreting PitNET that subsequently stimulates the adrenal glands to overproduce cortisol. Chronic\nexposure to excess cortisol has wide ranging and detrimental effects on health, including increased stroke rates,\ndiabetes, obesity, depression, anxiety and death. Although CD is linked to a threefold increase in the risk of\ndeath, the advancement of current standard of care medical therapy is lacking. Current treatments exhibit low\nefficacy and tolerability for patients. The first-line treatment for CD is pituitary surgery. In the hands of an\nexperienced surgeon, tumor recurrence occurs in as many as 56% of patients during the 10-year follow-up\nperiod. Despite multiple treatments, biochemical control is not achieved in approximately 50% of patients,\nsuggesting that in routine clinical practice, initial and long-term disease remission is not achieved in a substantial\nnumber of CD patients. Hence, medical therapy is often considered in the following situations: when surgery is\ncontraindicated or fails to achieve remission, or when recurrence occurs after apparent surgical remission. While\nstereotactic radiosurgery treats incompletely resected or recurrent PitNETs, the main drawbacks include the\nlonger time to remission and the risk of hypopituitarism. Our research team has published data demonstrating\nthat organoids derived from corticotroph type PitNETs consist of differentiated cell lineages, stem/progenitor\ncells, and immune and stromal cells that replicate much of the patient’s own tumor pathology, function, and\ngenetic alterations. Our team’s expertise in organoid technology has enabled the first successful development\nand implementation of this advanced 3D culture in the much-needed PitNET research arena. Using human\nPitNET organoids we have revealed stem and progenitor cell populations that express an antioxidant mechanism\nthat may be targeted to prevent tumor recurrence and medical- and radiation-therapy resistance\ndevelop Specific Aims: 1) Take a noncommittal research approach to define the molecular\n. This led us to\nsignatures of\ncorticotroph tumor subtypes in CD, and 2) Leverage the complementary value of the human hypothalamic-\npituitary-adrenal (HPA) Axis-On-A-Chip and the canine naturally occurring CD model to accelerate targeted\ntherapies for patients with CD. The objectives will be successfully achieved by collaborative efforts between the\nUniversity of Arizona (UA), Barrow Neurological Institute (BNI), University of Georgia Athens (UGA) that will\nleverage the expertise of professionals trained in complimentary fields including surgical treatments, pathology\nand cell biology of pituitary disease, organoid technology, canine preclinical in vitro and in vivo models and high\nthroughput data analysis including dug screening, molecular profiling, and transcriptomics. At the completion of\nthe funding period, we will be positioned to implement patient-relevant organoids to accelerate the development\nof therapies that will effectively target ACTH-secreting pituitary adenomas in patients with CD.",

    "abstract_text": "Project Summary\nCoupling high-throughput omics technologies with machine learning and the phenotypic-based drug discovery\nparadigm allows for data-driven drug discovery (D4). D4 has the advantage of being unbiased, like phenotypic-\nbased drug discovery, but the comprehensive measurements of 100s to 100,000s of biological features also\nenables characterizing drug perturbations and disease signatures to gain mechanistic insights. The predominant\ndata type for D4 has been transcriptomics and more recently image-based assays. Other biomolecules (i.e.,\nproteins and metabolites) are considered closer to the phenotype, however technical challenges in data\ngeneration and analysis, as well as the lack of standardized data analysis pipelines have limited the systematic\nuse of these data types. Sinopia Bioscience and Omix Technologies have combined their strengths in systems\nbiology data analysis, AI/ML, and LC-MS/MS based metabolomics to develop a unique metabolomics-based\nplatform that has allowed for systematic metabolic characterization of a chemical library consisting of ~3,300\nsmall molecules covering more than 1,000 drug targets. Our preliminary results demonstrate that metabolomics\nis more sensitive, reproducible, and predictive of the mechanism of action of these small molecules than\ntranscriptomics. Further, we found that using metabolomics data we could predict cell line specific toxicity of\ncancer drugs in viability assays. Importantly, we found we could derive metabolic signatures of sensitivity and\nresistance and use these to identify secondary compounds that can enhance sensitivity to cancer drugs. In this\nPhase I proposal, we will expand on these findings and develop novel algorithms to better understand how\nbaseline metabolic states of cancers affect their sensitivity to cancer drugs. As a development test case we will\nfocus on sensitivity of breast cancer cell lines to docetaxel and tucatinib. First, we will perform high throughput\nmetabolomics and analysis of 100 cancer cell lines to characterize metabolism both in a baseline state and after\nadministration of docetaxel and tucatinib. Second, we will develop novel computational algorithms for predicting\nthe ability of compounds to sensitize cancer cells to cancer drugs. Finally, we will experimentally validate novel\ncompound combinations and generate metabolomics data to further improve our algorithms. Success of this\nPhase I proposal will lead to validated metabolomics-based methods for identifying underlying metabolic\nphenotypes predictive of drug sensitivity, which will then be leveraged to predict the effects of compound\ncombinations. This allows us to further expand Sinopia’s platform’s capabilities and its application to oncology\napplications through partnerships with biotech/pharma and/or fundraising through outside investors. In addition,\nit would lead to novel use of targets and compounds to enhance the sensitivity to existing cancer treatments that\nwe can internally develop. Phase II will focus on further development of the platform, expanding our\nmetabolomics-based library, and advancing promising synergistic combinations into preclinical models.",

    "abstract_text": "Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have emerged as potent analytes in liquid biopsy, presenting diverse molecular\ncargo that can potentially inform somatic mutations, resistance proﬁles, and tumor recurrence. However, EVs\nremain underutilized in clinical assays due to technical challenges. Tumor-derived EVs comprise a small\nfraction (<5%) of total circulating EVs, and the marker contents in EVs are often very low (e.g., mRNA).\nConsequently, current EV analyses necessitate large sample volumes (>2 mL plasma) and sophisticated\nresources. Innovation. We aim to address these limitations by advancing CampEx (CRISPR-accelerated\nmolecular proﬁling of extracellular vesicles), an integrated platform for EV molecular analyses with exquisite\nsensitivity and precision. CampEx embodies our new breakthrough in CRISPR-based biosensing: CRISPR-\nassociated (Cas) proteins ﬁrst recognize their speciﬁc mRNA target, an event that triggers RNA replication and\nsignal ampliﬁcation. This unique mechanism enables CampEx to differentiate between single-nucleotide\npolymorphisms while achieving a detection limit in the sub-attomolar ranges. Goals. Our recent study validated\nthe CampEx concept in pre-clinical and clinical samples. Building on these promising results, we aim to\nadvance CampEx to a robust, clinically translatable diagnostic platform. We seek two complementary\nobjectives: i) enhancing CampEx's analytical capabilities to enable high-throughput and comprehensive EV\nanalysis and ii) rigorously evaluating EVs' value for precision oncology. Aim 1. We will expand CampEx's\nanalytical targets (>40 markers). The mRNA detection panel will include i) key driver genes and mutations that\naccount for >90% of cancer cases and ii) markers of chemotherapy resistance. Furthermore, we will\nincorporate protein detection into the CampEx assay ﬂow, capitalizing on EVs' inherent advantage as multi-\ncargo carriers. We will validate the designed probes, adhering to regulatory (FDA) guidelines to obtain\nanalytical statistics. Aim 2. We will implement a high-throughput, automated CampEx instrument capable of\nperforming 96 parallel measurements. This new system will incorporate our novel \"digital modulation\" strategy\nto enhance the robustness of signal detection. Completing this aim will produce a practical system suitable for\nroutine laboratory applications. Aim 3. We will apply CampEx to analyze clinical plasma samples for early\ntumor detection and treatment monitoring, focusing on two cancer types: ovarian cancer and colorectal cancer.\nThis study will determine CampEx's clinical assay performance, including sensitivity, speciﬁcity, and correlation\nwith clinical outcomes. To accomplish our goal, we have assembled an interdisciplinary team (biosensing, EV\nbiology, clinical research, bioinformatics) and clinical resources. Completing this project will establish CampEx\nas an impactful platform, enabling multi-marker detection in a cohesive single platform. Ultimately, CampEx\nwill expedite preclinical and clinical readouts, thus augmenting EVs' clinical utility in precision cancer care.",

    "abstract_text": "The successful implementation of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapies relies on effective cell product\nmanufacturing. This process not only affects the cost, safety and efficacy of the final product but also plays a\ncrucial role in ensuring broader patient access to this innovative treatment. The increasing demand for CAR-T\ntherapies has resulted in shortages due to inadequate manufacturing capacity, partly because of the centralized\nmanufacturing model. Remarkably, approximately 25% of patients with multiple myeloma died while on an\neligible CAR-T treatment waitlist. Although “off-the-self” allogeneic CAR-T cells may be manufactured in\ncentralized facilities at a larger scale, this approach is still in the early stages of development with several existing\nand perhaps unforeseen hurdles. Currently, autologous CAR-T therapies remain the most clinically and\nregulatory acceptable option for patients. An alternative approach is local manufacturing using automated\nplatforms like CliniMACS Prodigy. These efforts, aimed at democratizing supply, boosting production capacity,\nsimplifying logistics, and reducing turnaround time, encounter numerous hurdles to implement. These barriers\narise from the fact that current techniques for CAR-T cell manufacturing are rooted in decades-old methodologies\nused in research laboratories. The complex process of integrating these methods for large-scale production,\neven with automation, poses challenges in bioprocessing, engineering, and regulatory compliance. Here we\npropose an innovative approach, focusing on T cell biology, to overcome these obstacles for point-of-care CAR-\nT production by leveraging targeted microbubble-based technologies. This system has been applied for T cell\nselection, activation, and transduction in a conventional preclinical study for CAR-T based therapy. By\ncapitalizing on robust biological activities of the reagents and streamlining the process, we aim to make CAR-T\ncell production efficient, affordable, and accessible. We will develop a user-friendly kit that enables CAR-T cell\nproduction in settings equivalent to those used for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. The CAR-T cells\nmanufactured by this considerably simplified protocol will undergo standard cell release quality control and be\ntested in a preclinical mouse model for hematological malignancy. As we progress to Phase II, we will adapt our\nprotocols to manufacture CAR-T cells for treating both hematological malignancies and solid tumors to ensure\nversatility and relevance across different therapeutic contexts. Overall, the primary goal of this project is to\ngenerate high quality point-of-care CAR-T cells by a radically simplified manufacturing process without\nsubstantial investment for new staff and infrastructures. When successful, it will drastically lower the\nmanufacturing costs, potentially eliminate “waitlist mortality” and likely alleviate regulatory burdens.",

    "abstract_text": "SUMMARY\nMeasuring immunospecific binding of target nucleic acids (NA) to single stranded DNA (ssDNA) probes\nimmobilized on solid surface has revolutionized molecular biology analysis from basic science to medicine.\nHowever, microarray-based technologies including Next Generation Sequencing can detect mutations with high\nprecision but have limited ability to quantify copy numbers. The gold standard for NA quantification, qPCR is\nlimited to meet the current need to quantify small NA, such as miRNA at required sensitivity in attomolar (aM)\nrange for applications such as liquid biopsy for diagnosis and prognosis. Label-free, enzyme-free electro-\nchemical approaches, particularly Electrochemical Beacon (EcB) is a promising technology to make microarray\nquantitative. However, the limit of quantification (LOQ) is only ~10 pM due to the complexity of the probe design\nwhich is a folded structure with complex conformation. In the proposed EcB study a simple binary probe is\ndesigned comprising of short reporter DNA (R) tethered to the electrode with longer probe (P) complimentary to\nthe target (T) of interest. The R has a redox active dye, methylene blue (MB) tethered to the free-end. On P-T\nbinding the released R brings MB in proximity to the electrode resulting in a signal. The research strategy is to\ndesign an R-P probe such that there is no signal from the binary probe and a signal is generated on each P-T\nbinding, i.e., positive contrast. The background is well controlled to have low false positives and negatives. The\ngoal is to use a special opto-electrochemical tool called SEED to read P-T binding to a microarray of binary\nprobes on a monolith electrode by measuring local redox on 10 micron spots to obtain LOQ of 10 attomolars\nwith dynamic range of over seven orders of magnitude to profile a mixture of ~25 miRNA sequences on a chip.\nThe premise is based on previously published result showing SEED has the required sensitivity. The study will\nbe organized in two specific aims: Specific Aim 1: Binary Probe design verification. The goal will be to, (a) create\na “perfect switch” where before binding all (R-P) probes show no signal and, on each P-T binding the released\nR contributes to a redox signal. and (b) establish calibration curves to quantify mixtures of up to 25 synthetic\nssRNA (or analogous ssDNA) targets with background of non-specific NAs. Specific Aim 2: Validation of binary\nprobe design. The goal will be to quantify ~25 miRNA in cell line and exosomes suspended in its media. The\ncells will be cultured with/without UV exposure. The success will be a quantitative profile of ~25 miRNA\nsequences in biological sample with [c] ranging from ~10 aM to ~1 nM. On success, collaborations will be initiated\nto translate the application to 3D culture (organoid/spheroid), stem cell differentiation and liquid biopsy\napplications.",

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nThe mass production of tissues and organs is the ultimate goal of biomanufacturing, but this goal will not be\nachieved without the assistance of engineering design tools that predict how three-dimensional, multicellular\nstructures, comprised of cells that dynamically respond to each other and their environment, self-organize into\nspatially patterned tissues. To date, no such design tools exist, and our high-risk, high-reward proposal seeks\nto develop and validate the first multiscale computational model to inform the design, fabrication, and self-\nassembly of tissues comprised of heterogeneous cell types engineered with synthetic gene circuits regulating\ncell adhesion. We recently published a relatively simple agent-based computational model, that when coupled\nwith machine learning algorithms, identifies design parameters that generate multicell spheroids, or simple\ntissues, comprised of heterogeneous subpopulations of cells that self-organize into specific patterns (e.g.,\nstriped, soccer ball, core/shell, and core/pole). The proposed work will greatly elaborate this simple model to a\nmultiscale computational model to predict how collections of bioprinted spheroids form into spatially patterned\n“assembloids.” We will utilize mixed populations of two cell types genetically engineered with highly modular\nsynNotch synthetic gene circuits, which propagate intracellular signals to regulate cell-cell adhesion strength\nbased on cell-cell interactions. We will also leverage state-of-the-art 3D printing spheroid positioning\ntechnology developed at our institution to precisely place three-dimensional spheroids adjacent to one another\nwithin a synthetic biomaterial that facilitates the formation of engineered tissue constructs. In Aim 1, we will\ndevelop a novel multiscale agent-based computational model that predicts how synNotch-mediated\nintercellular signaling and intracellular signaling in individual cells gives rise to self-sorting of heterogeneous\ncell populations, leading to the emergent patterning of three-dimensional tissues. We will run tens of thousands\nof simulations and apply clustering algorithms to extract design parameters that favor certain three-dimensional\ntissue patterns over others. In Aim 2, we will experimentally validate that the computational model can be\nreliably used to design three-dimensional multicellular tissue constructs by challenging it to identify the design\nparameters (e.g., initial number of cells, ratio of cell subpopulations, heterotypic and homotypic cell-cell\nadhesion strengths) that will generate three-dimensional assembloids with specific multicellular patterns. We\nwill culture synNotch cells into spheroids and spatially position them into tissue assembloids according to the\ndesign parameters predicted by the computer model, and then we will assess if the experimental tissues,\nimaged using confocal microscopy, exhibit the spatial patterns predicted by the computational model. We\nexpect that our project, which tightly integrates computational modeling with experiments, will significantly\nadvance the fields of three-dimensional bioprinting, biomanufacturing, and multiscale computational modeling\nof multicellular tissues and enable the robust generation of complex tissue structures by design.",

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nThe mass production of tissues and organs is the ultimate goal of biomanufacturing, but this goal will not be\nachieved without the assistance of engineering design tools that predict how three-dimensional, multicellular\nstructures, comprised of cells that dynamically respond to each other and their environment, self-organize into\nspatially patterned tissues. To date, no such design tools exist, and our high-risk, high-reward proposal seeks\nto develop and validate the first multiscale computational model to inform the design, fabrication, and self-\nassembly of tissues comprised of heterogeneous cell types engineered with synthetic gene circuits regulating\ncell adhesion. We recently published a relatively simple agent-based computational model, that when coupled\nwith machine learning algorithms, identifies design parameters that generate multicell spheroids, or simple\ntissues, comprised of heterogeneous subpopulations of cells that self-organize into specific patterns (e.g.,\nstriped, soccer ball, core/shell, and core/pole). The proposed work will greatly elaborate this simple model to a\nmultiscale computational model to predict how collections of bioprinted spheroids form into spatially patterned\n“assembloids.” We will utilize mixed populations of two cell types genetically engineered with highly modular\nsynNotch synthetic gene circuits, which propagate intracellular signals to regulate cell-cell adhesion strength\nbased on cell-cell interactions. We will also leverage state-of-the-art 3D printing spheroid positioning\ntechnology developed at our institution to precisely place three-dimensional spheroids adjacent to one another\nwithin a synthetic biomaterial that facilitates the formation of engineered tissue constructs. In Aim 1, we will\ndevelop a novel multiscale agent-based computational model that predicts how synNotch-mediated\nintercellular signaling and intracellular signaling in individual cells gives rise to self-sorting of heterogeneous\ncell populations, leading to the emergent patterning of three-dimensional tissues. We will run tens of thousands\nof simulations and apply clustering algorithms to extract design parameters that favor certain three-dimensional\ntissue patterns over others. In Aim 2, we will experimentally validate that the computational model can be\nreliably used to design three-dimensional multicellular tissue constructs by challenging it to identify the design\nparameters (e.g., initial number of cells, ratio of cell subpopulations, heterotypic and homotypic cell-cell\nadhesion strengths) that will generate three-dimensional assembloids with specific multicellular patterns. We\nwill culture synNotch cells into spheroids and spatially position them into tissue assembloids according to the\ndesign parameters predicted by the computer model, and then we will assess if the experimental tissues,\nimaged using confocal microscopy, exhibit the spatial patterns predicted by the computational model. We\nexpect that our project, which tightly integrates computational modeling with experiments, will significantly\nadvance the fields of three-dimensional bioprinting, biomanufacturing, and multiscale computational modeling\nof multicellular tissues and enable the robust generation of complex tissue structures by design.",

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nNine out of ten drug candidates that are shown to be safe and effective in animal testing ultimately fail in\nhuman trials. A great deal of work over the last decade has focused on leveraging pluripotent stem cells to\ncreate human organoids and microphysiological organ-on-chip models which present a lower cost, ethical,\nscalable, and more physiologically-relevant alternative to animal testing. These organoids are 3D tissues\nrepresenting the full range of cell phenotypes present in various human organ systems. With the recent\npassage of the FDA Modernization Act 2.0, congress has allowed FDA to accept organoids as alternatives\nto animal testing for drug approvals. Organoid model development has also been broadly prioritized across\nthe NIH. As organoids move toward translational practice, there is a large and growing unmet need\nfor new bioreactor tools designed specifically for organoid culture. Mosaic is leveraging fifteen years\nof microfluidics research and high-volume manufacturing experience to create a versatile, programmable,\neasy-to-use, and scalable perfusion bioreactor platform for microphysiological systems. We are\npartnering with early adopters in the emerging organoid and cell therapy industries as well as manufacturing\npartners with expertise in injection molding microfluidic consumables. Our platform overcomes several major\nbottlenecks in the development and scalable application of organ-on-chip assays for drug discovery. Our\nmicrofluidic consumable follows a standard SBS plate form factor, allowing it to be integrated into\nbroader laboratory automation workflows. Our low-cost electronic pressure manifold leverages recent\nadvances in MEMS technology to precisely drive fluids and actuate on-chip valves across a standardized\nmicrofluidic consumable interface. In this Phase I, we will validate this platform by demonstrating iPSC\ncardiovascular organoid differentiation and observation under perfusion culture. We will show that a single\nbioreactor yields hundreds of healthy, phenotypically-consistent vascularized cardiac organoids,\nand that these organoids can be differentially dosed with pharmacological agents under\nphysiologically-relevant perfusion conditions. We will develop an intuitive scripting interface for\nautomating cell culture and screening protocols. Our first product (Phase II) is an R&D hardware and software\nplatform for microfluidic bioreactor automation compatible with standard live cell imaging microscopes. Our\nlong-term goal is to develop a fully-integrated system with imaging and microfluidic automation,\nalong with a catalog of standard microfluidic consumables for a variety of use cases including\nhepatocyte culture for toxicity screening, tumor spheroid perfusion, suspension culture for immunotherapy\nproduction, and general cell biology.",

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT\nOur goal is to understand how the lung microbiome regulates influenza virus infection response by developing a\n3D in vitro bioprinted platform to study host-microbiome-influenza interactions in the lung alveolar space. The\nrespiratory microbiome, encompassing hundreds of different bacterial and fungal species, has essential roles in\nthe development of tissue-specific immunity and colonization resistance to pathogens, including viral infection.\nThe lung and alveolar space undergo constant microbial exposure from the inhalation of oropharyngeal contents.\nNotably, sequencing-based studies have identified a low biomass but diverse microbial signature in healthy\nindividuals. However, a detailed mechanistic understanding of how these diverse microbes interact with host\ncells to maintain lung health and contribute to viral infection susceptibility is currently lacking. Major knowledge\ngaps exist due to 1) the substantial biodiversity of the lung microbiome, 2) difficulties in modeling the complexity\nof the human lung environment, and 3) limited information about where in the lung epithelium these interactions\ntake place and what are the cell-type specific host responses. Additionally, Current approaches lack the capacity\nto model host-microbe interactions in the lung at transcriptional and spatial resolution. We will overcome these\nlimitations by developing two new technologies – a 3D bioprinted alveolar sac model and dual host-microbe\nspatial transcriptomics (ST) – to enhance our understanding of the host response to microbial colonization in an\nadvanced, anatomically relevant lung model. The ability to examine which and how specific microbes interact\nwith the lung epithelium and the effect these interactions on influenza infection would be valuable to investigate\nthe microbiome’s role in lung health and infection response. In Aim 1, we will develop and characterize a 3D\nbioprinted ventilated alveolar sac model. We will then evaluate its influenza infection response using ST and\nsingle-cell RNA-sequencing. In Aim 2, we will examine how diverse respiratory microbiota condition the alveolar\nepithelium to affect influenza infection response. We will develop a dual ST method to simultaneously profile\nhost transcriptional response and microbial/viral localization. We will then use this method to examine how\nmicrobial conditioning of the epithelium affects influenza infection dynamics. Together, these aims will allow us\nto address fundamental questions on the underlying biology of the lung microbiome and its effect on influenza\nresponse. Our success would result in two new technologies facilitating the construction of a high-resolution\nspatial map of the microbiome-host interactions. This advancement would enable in-depth investigations into the\nmechanisms of interstrain interactions, virulence regulation, and their impact on lung immune homeostasis and\ninfection response.",

Conduits made of\nrealistic tissue components present as long-lasting solutions capable of adapting with the body and integrating\nwith host cells, thus offering enhanced, physiologically mimicking functionality. Bioprinting is an enabling\napproach toward generating user-designable tissues, with potential for maximizing accommodation for patient-\nspecific needs. However, current bioprinting techniques are restricted in the types of materials that can be used\nas bioinks, typically relying on artificial materials/modifiers in bioink solutions or extremely high concentrations\nand acidity to enable printability, which limit biocompatibility and versatility. Many natural, physiological materials\nremain unprintable, especially with direct inclusion of cells within the bioinks. Moreover, key limitations in existing\nTEVCs (which are typically not bioprinted) include high incidence of stenosis in patients, thus elevating the risks\nof utilizing such products as the clinical gold standard.\n In this proposed study, we will develop highly tunable and customizable TEVCs utilizing a novel\nbioprinting method capable of directly printing fully physiological materials, including cell-laden tissues. Our\nmethod is fast, enabling rapid production of TEVCs with custom features. We will further incorporate universal\nimmunocompatible human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived cells, including endothelial cells, in our\nbioprinted TEVCs to generate highly biomimicking living vessels with a functional endothelium, which will be\nconditioned and matured to enhance vessel function prior to implantation experiments. Matured TEVCs will\nsubsequently be implanted in vivo into humanized rats to evaluate performance enhancements.

    "abstract_text": "Project summary\nOver 80% of symptomatic temporomandibular joint disorders (TMJD) patients have a TMJ disc displacement,\nlinked with osteoarthritis (OA). The abnormal jaw mechanics involved with TMJ disc displacement can lead to\ndisc thinning and perforation, frequently progressing into OA. In the last decade, we and others have actively\nexplored regenerative approaches for severely damaged TMJ discs with some promising pre-clinical outcomes.\nHowever, the regenerative strategies for TMJ disc should be evaluated considering the abnormal joint mechanics\nand inflammation caused by joint trauma or disc displacement. In addition, TMJ is a multi-tissue organ where\nmultiple tissues, including cartilage, bone, TMJ discs, synovium, ligaments, and surrounding fat, are believed to\ninteract with each other for joint function, homeostasis, disease initiation, and progress. Unfortunately, we have\nan extremely limited understanding of multi-tissue crosstalk in TMJ, linked with a paucity of reliable experimental\nmodels. The objective of this proposal is to develop and validate a patient-specific TMJ-on-a-chip (TMJoC) model\nfor investigating multi-tissue crosstalk regulating TMJ disc injury and healing under inflammation and\npathophysiological mechanical stimulation. Our team has extensive experience in joint-on-a-chip (JoC) for multi-\ntissue interactions in the knee joint during meniscus injury and healing. Based on the expertise, we have\ndeveloped a TMJoC integrated into a novel TMJ disc-specific bioreactor, consisting of i) a joint cavity where\ndiscs are cultured and physio/chemically stimulated, ii) bioprinted synovial membrane layered with lining\nmacrophages and synovial mesenchymal stem/progenitor cells (MSCs), iii) tissue-engineered ligaments, iv)\nengineered osteochondral tissues and v) MSCs-derived adipose tissues. Gene expression profiles of the\nengineered tissues were validated using RNA-seq data from human tissues. Tissue compartments were\nseparated by semi-permeable membranes, and under-layered microfluidic channels supply tissue-specific media.\nMechanical loading units replicating patient-specific condyle and fossa anatomy are integrated to apply\nphysiological loading to TMJ discs in the TMJoC via 3-axis micro-precise motion controllers. Our preliminary\ndata suggest that the healing of TMJ disc perforation by our well-established bioactive glue was interfered with\nIL-1β, and physiological loading attenuates the harmful effect of IL-1β. Interactions with synovium further\nhampered disc healing with elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines, mitigated by an existence of adipose tissue.\nscRNA-seq with CellChat analysis suggested robust communications between adipocytes, MSCs, and\nmacrophages in discs healing, highlighting fat's notable metabolic and anti-inflammatory functions. As supported\nby solid preliminary data, we aim to 1) determine the roles of multi-tissue crosstalk in TMJ under inflammation\nand pathophysiological mechanical loadings and 2) establish a patient-specific TMJoC from human iPSCs. The\nproposed TMJoC, as a patient-specific platform, has a wide range of research applications, including TMJ\nhomeostasis, metabolism, biology of disease initiation and progress.",

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT\nReconstructive surgery is the main treatment strategy to repair craniomaxillofacial (CMF) injuries. However,\nsurgical options are often antiquated, leading to suboptimal outcomes, both functionally and cosmetically. Tissue\nengineered ‘replacement grafts’ represent the next era of reconstructive surgery. However, clinical translation is\nstill profoundly limited by the lack of prompt vascularization following implantation. This leads to necrosis and\nreconstructive failure. Thus, there exists significant clinical need for an effective method that circumvents current\nlimitations of graft vascularization. Our premise, based upon extensive clinical and tissue engineering expertise\nalong with rigorous preliminary data is that new surgical and engineering approaches can be used to not only\naugment graft vascularization but also purposely orient microvascular ingrowth. We have recently developed a\nnovel microsurgical tactic termed “vascular micropuncture” (MP) that significantly augments the angiogenic\npotential of the surgical site. With MP, we use an ultrafine needle (e.g., 60 µm) to create perforations in the\ntargeted recipient macrovasculature to enable cell extravasation and angiogenesis, expediting the time to\nadjacent scaffold vascularization. With these compelling results, we propose to advance our microsurgical\nmethod using emerging three-dimensional (3D) printing technologies. Based on our unique approach, our\noverarching hypothesis is that MP will improve vascularization and survival of 3D printed or bioprinted bone\ngrafts. To test this hypothesis, we will work on two complementary, but independent, aims. In Aim 1, using a rat\nmodel we will test the effectiveness of MP in vascularizing calvarial defects directly from the sagittal sinus vein.\nFollowing a defined implantation period, vascularization will be quantified via laser doppler, angiography,\nimmunohistochemistry, and protein analysis. Next, a novel 3D air printing technique will be used to generate\nvascularized channels within 3D scaffolds, which will be used to guide the orientation of microvascular ingrowth.\nWe will also perform a sheep study to demonstrate MP scalability and translatability. In Aim 2, we will assess\nthe potential of sagittal sinus MP to directly induce the vascularization of bioprinted bone grafts. Sagittal sinus\nMP will be coordinated with implantation of an engineered bone graft fabricated via a novel high-throughput\nbioprinting method using high-cell density osteogenically committed spheroids. Vascularized bone\nvolume/density will be evaluated using micro-computed tomography and histology. Accomplishment of these\nindependent aims together will allow us to establish a groundbreaking surgical approach for tissue engineered\ngraft vascularization and ultimately improve patient care.",
