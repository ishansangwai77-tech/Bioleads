    "abstract_text": "Advances in cell culture techniques and stem cell technology have enabled generation of 3-\ndimensional organoids capable of recapitulating the structure and physiology of human organs\nbetter than 2D cultures. These organoids can aid in identifying early biomarkers of diseases, and\nunderstanding the impact of environmental factors on the initiation and progression of diseases.\nWe recently used our human heart organoids (hHOs) derived from human induced pluripotent\nstem cells (iPSCs) to explore changes in lipid profile mediated by endoplasmic reticulum (ER)\nstress sensor proteins.\nExogenous chemicals (e.g., per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), drugs, etc.) and\nendogenous metabolites (e.g., cholesterol and saturated fatty acids (SFAs)) negatively affect\ncardiac function. PFAS are found in many household cleaning products and commercial\npackaging materials. Once released to the environment, these “forever chemicals” degrade\nslowly, resulting in detectable levels in drinking water, food, and animals, including humans. PFAS\nare ubiquitous environmental contaminants that also accumulate in the food chain, which is one\nof the main routes of human exposure. Evidence have linked PFAS to altered lipid profile and\ncardiovascular disease (CVD). We and others have found that PFAS induces ER stress, notably\ninositol-requiring enzyme 1α (IRE1α) signaling. ER stress and activation of IRE1α is involved in\nvarious conditions that advance heart diseases. Thus far, studies on the changes in lipid\ncomposition induced by PFAS has been limited to cholesterol, lipoproteins and TG. We found that\n(i) IRE1α mediates changes in the lipid profile (notably, long-chain fatty acids) in our hHOs, and\n(ii) PFAS activates IRE1α signaling and is linked to dyslipidemia and CVD risk. Therefore, we\nhypothesize that PFAS activation of IRE1α signaling alters the lipid profiles and negatively affects\ncardiac function. We further propose that our organoids, which contain epicardial cells (that\nprovide trophic factors and can mediate lipid metabolism) in addition to cardiomyocytes, enable\ninvestigation of the influence of epicardial cells on the cardiac lipid profile and function. In the first\naim, we will investigate the changes in lipid content (i.e., very long chain long chain fatty acids:\nodd and even) and cardiac function induced by PFAS exposure and mediated by IRE1α. In the\nsecond aim, we will investigate the PFAS-induced changes in lipid profile and cardiac function\nmediated by the epicardium.",

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nThis proposal will develop a multi-functional interface to measure and modulate the activity of neural organoid\ncultures. The first generation of this Compliant Reversible Actuator and Detector Leveraging Electrophysiology\n(Organoid-CRADLE) will include a multi-electrode array (MEA) and light-emitting diodes (LEDs) for optogenetic\nexperiments. The LEDs will interface with NeuroLux’s existing suite of hardware and software for optogenetic\nexperiments, while the MEA will interface with hardware from other established vendors. The Organoid-CRADLE\nwill have several transformational advantages over status quo technologies. The Organoid-CRADLE will use a\nrevolutionary soft robotic structure to grip non-adherent organoid cultures and position electrodes and µLEDs on\nthe organoid surface. Conventional MEAs are flat, making them incompatible with the curved shape of an\norganoid. Even next-generation 3D MEAs that are curved for compatibility with organoids currently have a static\nshape. Therefore, it is difficult to design them to perform well with multiple organoids because organoids vary\nsignificantly in size and shape, even within a single batch. Our device solves this problem because it has soft\narms that gradually curl up from a flat position when pressurized. Instead of being designed to match the shape\nof a target organoid, the device is designed to conform to the size and shape of whatever organoid it encounters,\nmaking it much more versatile than other state-of-the-art devices. Another problem with competing devices is\nthat the contact is not reversible. The Organoid-CRADLE can disengage from the organoid at any time without\ndamaging the device or injuring the organoid. As a result, a single device can record from several different\norganoids in rotation. Also, an organoid that is used for recording can be released unharmed for use in other\nprocedures. Neither of these approaches is possible with competing devices and both will be highly valued by\nour target customers. We will prepare this revolutionary product for market by focusing on its geometry, MEA\nfunctionality, and optical stimulation functionality. We will optimize the geometry to maximize contact area without\ninducing injury. We will demonstrate that an array of electrodes can be embedded in the device and validate\ntheir ability to record the activity of the organoid. Finally, we will demonstrate that tiny µLEDs can be attached to\nthe device and used to induce activity in appropriately-prepared, light sensitive organoids. The capacity to\ncapture an organoid without injuring it and then release it is useful independent of the other functionality of the\ndevice. Similarly, MEA and optical stimulation functionality are also independently valuable. In combination,\nthese features will move organoid electrophysiology from being a challenging assay available only to large, well-\nresourced labs to being a routine assay available to startups and small academic labs across the world.\nTherefore, we anticipate that this product will not only quickly dominate the market for organoid electrophysiology\nbut also ultimately expand it by making it more accessible.",

    "abstract_text": "Project Summary\nAlcohol-associated hepatitis (AH) is a severe, potentially life-threatening form of alcohol-associated liver\ndisease (ALD) with limited therapeutic options. Cholestasis and biliary dysfunction are common in AH\npatients and can worsen AH prognosis. Plasma membrane integrity usually determines whether a form\nof cell death is pro-inflammatory. Lytic cell death pathways can cause plasma membrane changes and\neventually lead to plasma membrane rupture (PMR), which releases intracellular contents that stimulate\nthe immune response. The role of PMR in ALD remains unknown. There is a critical need to determine\nthe role of cholestasis in promoting PMR in ALD and the therapeutic potential of targeting PMR in AH.\nThe long-term goal is to contribute toward the development of clinically useful, mechanism-based\ndiagnostic and therapeutic interventions to improve outcomes in patients with advanced ALD. The overall\nobjectives for this proposal are to 1) determine the role of PMR in ALD, and 2) investigate the\nmechanism by which cholestasis promotes hepatocellular PMR in the setting of ALD. The central\nhypothesis is that cholestasis promotes PMR in hepatocytes, thereby enhancing alcohol-associated liver\ndamage. The rationale for the proposed research is based on the identification of cholestatic injury in a\npreclinical model of AH. The overall objectives of this application will be attained by pursuing two specific\naims: (1) Determine the role of PMR in ALD; (2) Investigate the mechanism by which cholestasis\npromotes hepatocellular PMR in ALD. Under the first aim, the working hypothesis will be determined in\nmice and in vitro cell or organoid cultures with a key PMR contributor knocked down by vivo-\nmorpholinos. For the second aim, the working hypothesis will be tested in liver tissues from ALD patients\nand in in vitro cell or organoid cultures to understand the role of bile acid-mediated pathways in PMR.\nThe contribution of this proposal will be to determine the role of PMR during the progression of ALD and\nbegin to clarify the mechanisms underlying hepatocellular PMR in ALD. Upon completion of the proposed\nproject, there is the promise that a significant advance in understanding the mechanism of AH will have\nbeen made, and a mechanistic link will have been established between cholestasis and hepatocellular\nPMR in ALD. The successful completion of the proposed studies will be significant because they are\nexpected to offer novel therapeutic targets for ALD.",

    "abstract_text": "ABSTRACT\n This project will provide critical evidence to advance multiple non-abstinence endpoints through the conduct\nof a clinical trial that will evaluate how reduced methamphetamine use impacts a diverse range of outcomes in\nindividuals seeking treatment for Methamphetamine Use Disorder (MUD). The rise in MUD is a growing public\nhealth concern with rates of methamphetamine-associated overdose greatly increasing, especially in\nunderserved populations, made worse by a lack of approved or implemented MUD interventions.\nMethamphetamine use is associated with a range of health concerns that can be non-abstinence treatment\ntargets but that have yet to be prospectively evaluated in clinical trials. This trial seeks to determine whether\nreduced methamphetamine use improves outcomes like cardiovascular health, immune function, sleep quality\nand other measures related to psychosocial function. We propose a randomized, controlled 12-week trial using\nincentives to reduce methamphetamine use, with an additional 12 weeks of follow up. We will randomly assign\ntreatment seeking subjects with MUD to one of two groups (1:1; n=100/group): 1) incentives for providing one\nor fewer methamphetamine positive urine samples per week in the trial, in which frequency of use is expected\nto be substantially reduced or 2) a non-contingent control group, in which frequency of use is expected to\nremain stable. We will assess improvements in selected outcomes using validated self-report items and\nobjective measures, including blood biomarkers. This research will fill a critical knowledge gap with impactful\ndata about the biomedical and psychosocial benefits of reduced methamphetamine use, which can then be\nused to advance non-abstinence outcomes as treatment indicators for MUD trials.",

    "abstract_text": "Project Summary/Abstract\n Child sexual abuse (CSA) is a significant, preventable major public health issue associated\nwith considerable adverse physical and mental health outcomes. Notably, CSA is typically\ncommitted by someone the child knows and trusts (CDC, 2024; Finkelhor & Shattuck, 2012),\nand a significant portion of sexual harm involves problematic sexual behavior (PSB) of youth\n(Gewirtz-Meydan & Finkelhor, 2020). Schools are on the frontline for preventing CSA and PSB\nof youth. Rural schools are particularly vulnerable to the impact of CSA due to health disparities,\nlow-resourced areas, and stigma (Morales et al., 2020). Consistent with recommendations of\nprevention leaders, Praesidium is a widely disseminated CSA and PSB prevention program\ndesigned to comprehensively address policies and procedures that shift the organizational\nculture to one of protection and child well-being. Program evaluations are promising, but\nrigorous evaluation has not yet been implemented. Directly teaching rules about boundaries and\nsexual behavior is critical to prevention of PSB. Both the ROAR and Stop-Go-Tell prevention\nprograms have been successfully implemented in numerous schools; report positive feedback\nfrom caregivers, students, and school personnel; and have considerable demand for the\nprogram in the state. The present study is a cluster randomized trial designed to rigorously\nexamine a comprehensive multi-layered approach to address prevention at the organization,\nprofessional, caregiver, and student levels (Praesidium with ROAR and Stop-Go-Tell integrated\nas consumer participation tools). Forty rural elementary schools that meet inclusion criteria will\nbe randomized to the intervention or waitlist control condition. Integration of consumer\n(caregiver, youth, school personnel, and partner agencies) authentic voices comprehensively\nduring the planning year and throughout the implementation and dissemination of the project is\ndesigned to enhance program and research quality, engagement, and reduce attrition. Further,\nstrategies to enhance impact and sustainability through repetition, self-analysis, and train-the-\ntrainer implementation will be tested. Qualitative methods will be utilized to examine contextual\nfactors impacting school culture, implementation fidelity, facilitators, barriers, costs, and\nunintended consequences. Oklahoma is prime to conduct this research as it builds on our\nlongstanding collaborative partnership among key leaders, investment of the state and\ncommunity in CSA and PSB prevention, and commitment to our rural communities. Results will\nhave important implications for prevention services to youth in underserved, diverse rural\ncommunities that is currently a critical gap in the CSA and PSB prevention literature.",

    "phr_text": "Project Narrative\n Primary and secondary schools are in the unique position to not only implement strategies\nto prevent child sexual abuse (CSA) but also to directly address problematic sexual behavior\n(PSB) of youth. Little research has rigorously evaluated system-wide standards in programs\ndesigned to combat CSA and PSB in school settings. This project aims to approach primary\nprevention of CSA and PSB through a multilayered approach addressing school-wide policy,\nprocedures, and training to shift school-wide organizational culture to embrace responsibility of\nstudent safety from CSA and PSB and integrating direct teaching to support knowledge and\npractice of CSA and PSB prevention skills in the classroom.",

    "abstract_text": "ABSTRACT\nUnderstanding and mitigating drug-induced liver injury (DILI) in children is crucial for pediatric healthcare.\nChildren are more prone to liver damage due to differences in drug metabolism, liver development, and unique\nsusceptibilities. DILI can cause immediate health risks and long-term issues like liver failure or chronic liver\ndisease. Since children often need medications for chronic diseases such as epilepsy, infections, and pain,\nensuring the safety of drugs is vital. Addressing DILI in children through advanced methods not only improves\ndrug safety but also supports personalized medicine, enhancing care quality and reducing adverse drug\nreactions. For example, acetaminophen, commonly used for pain and fever, can cause severe liver damage.\nValproic acid, used for epilepsy, also poses a risk of liver toxicity, especially with long-term use. In this\nproposal, we would like to investigate mechanisms of toxicity of acetaminophen, valproic acid, amoxicillin-\nclavulanate, cannabidiol (CBD), and isoniazid, which covers critical pharmaceuticals in pediatric healthcare,\nand develop biomarkers of pediatric DILI caused by these pharmaceuticals. The proposal has two main aims.\nAim 1 is to evaluate the effect of selected drugs on liver toxicity markers using a sandwich cultured human\nhepatocyte model leveraging primary human hepatocytes from pediatric and adult donors. This will involve\nmeasuring proteomic and metabolomic biomarkers in drug-treated hepatocyte lots from infants, children,\nadolescents, and adults to understand age-specific mechanisms of DILI. The study will also analyze\nproteomics data of extracellular vesicles and untargeted metabolomics of media to identify molecular changes\nand drug-protein adducts. These data will be integrated into mathematical models using quantitative systems\ntoxicology (QST) models to predict pathways and mechanisms of DILI. Aim 2 will measure the effects of acute\nand prolonged drug exposure using liver microphysiological system (MPS) using standardized liver tissue chip.\nBy analyzing proteins and metabolites released in the media from these systems, the study will assess\nimmediate and long-term impacts on liver function and toxicity in both pediatric and adult livers. Overall,\nutilizing advanced methodologies such as proteomics, metabolomics, and complex in vitro models, including\nMPS, the research will assess DILI across various pediatric age groups. Integrating these findings into\nmathematical models will provide a deeper understanding of DILI mechanisms and potentially identify specific\nbiomarkers relevant to children. Ultimately, when validated in clinic, pediatric DILI candidate biomarkers will\nenhance drug safety profiles, inform better prescribing practices, and support personalized treatment\napproaches in children.",
    "project_title": "Predictive approaches to mitigate risk of hepatotoxicity of drugs in children",
    "phr_text": "Narrative\nThe overarching goal for this research is to make medications safer for children by studying how common\ndrugs like acetaminophen and valproic acid can harm young livers. By understanding how liver cells from\ndifferent age groups respond to these drugs, drug developers and doctors can predict liver damage early.\nUltimately, this will lead to safer prescribing practices, better health outcomes for kids, and lower healthcare\ncosts.",

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY\n Chronic neurological impairments are a widespread consequence of both the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic\nand the subsequent surge in RSV that will place a lasting burden on healthcare systems worldwide. This\nincludes both purely cognitive symptoms (sleep disruption, confusion, and brain fog) as well as symptoms of\nperipheral and autonomic neuropathy (shortness of breath, intractable cough, headache, and stroke). While\nthe blood-brain barrier protects central nervous system (CNS), the peripheral nervous system (PNS) is more\ndirectly exposed to pathogens both in the nerve terminals innervating the upper respiratory tract and through\nthe general circulation. Unfortunately, viral invasion of the PNS is vastly understudied despite its constant\nexposure to pathogens and critical role in the regulation of normal bodily functions.\n Using innovative neural microphysiological systems (MPSs), we have recently demonstrated that RSV\ninfects both monocytes and neurons in peripheral nerve tissue, generates concerted chemokine release, and\ndose-dependently induces nerve hypersensitization or progressive neurotoxicity. Both neuronal infection and\ninflammation-mediated neuropathy are novel observations that could explain analogous mechanisms of\nperipheral neuroinvasion in humans that may contribute to sudden apnea experienced by infants exposed to\nRSV in utero, chronic airway hyperreactivity in children exposed to RSV in the perinatal period, and the\npersistent peripheral neuropathy and autonomic dysfunction associated with long COVID. Critically, MPSs\nsupport the use of rodent, human stem cell-derived, or primary cell types within the same model system,\nfacilitating comparison of analogous data across species towards translation of basic research findings to the\nclinic.\n The development of bioengineered models of the PNS and likewise the methodologies necessary for\nefficient, repeatable data extraction specifically from microphysiological peripheral nerve has received\nconsiderably less attention than analogous models of the CNS. Here we propose to establish the conditions\nnecessary to facilitate interaction between peripheral neurons, glia, and inflammatory cells in\nmicrophysiological culture to advance the meaningful complexity of microphysiological PNS modeling. We\nalso aim to identify the most stable and sensitive optogenetic tools for long-term longitudinal collection of\nneurophysiological data to maximize the utility of this MPS for detection of viral neuropathy. We will then\ndemonstrate the utility of the system by using it to compare peripheral neuropathy resulting from direct\nexposure to RSV and SARS-CoV-2. Completion of these goals will establish the feasibility of a novel, human-\nbased MPS capable of elucidating peripheral neurotropism of known and emerging viruses.",

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nObstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is known to be correlated with cardiovascular diseases (CVD), yet controlled\nclinical trials showed that CPAP treatment was insufficient to alleviate CVD risk in all patients. Current tools fail\nto identify the mechanistic pathways involved in OSA-related CVD pathophysiology, and residual CVD risk may\npersist despite CPAP treatment. Conversely, some studies have identified OSA as possibly protective against\nmyocardial infarction consequences, highlighting significant knowledge gaps in understanding the mechanisms\nlinking OSA and CVD. This research project aims to elucidate the complex relationship between OSA and CVD\nthrough an innovative \"bed to bench\" approach, integrating clinical, in silico, and in vitro techniques. Specifically,\nwe will develop and validate a novel mathematical model to quantify tissue-specific hypoxia burden in OSA\npatients, correlating this with clinical outcomes and traditional OSA metrics. This model will be validated using\nsuperoxide expression in microvascular tissue from patient skin biopsies and further refined with large-scale\nsleep study databases from the Sleep Heart Health Study (SHHS). Second, we will optimize in vitro\nmicrovascular models, including an endothelial cell model and an advanced Vascularized Micro-Organ (VMO)\nplatform, to study the direct effects of intermittent hypoxia (IH) on the microvasculature. The IH protocol will be\ndeveloped to match gene expression profiles of IH-exposed endothelial cells to patient biopsy profiles to ensure\nphysiological relevance. Third, we will employ a \"heart-on-a-chip\" model to investigate the direct impact of OSA-\ninduced IH on cardiac structure and function, providing insights into OSA-specific cardiovascular pathways.\nThroughout these aims, we will leverage data from the National Sleep Research Resource to inform our models\nand validate our findings against real-world patient outcomes. This comprehensive approach addresses current\nlimitations in OSA research by providing more accurate risk assessment tools and physiologically relevant in\nvitro models. Our strategy has the potential to uncover new biomarkers, identify novel therapeutic targets, and\nultimately improve the clinical management of OSA patients at risk for cardiovascular complications.",

    "abstract_text": "Project Summary\nIn the United States alone, more than 123,000 men, women and children currently need lifesaving organ\ntransplants (https://optn.transplant.hrsa.gov/). Every 10 minutes another name is added to the national organ\ntransplant waiting list. Sadly, an average of 22 people die each day due to lack of available life-saving organ,\nwith the numbers expected to increase every year. The same is true for patients on liver transplantation waitlist.\nIn the United States, there are an average of 12,000 patients waiting for a liver transplantation at any given\ntime. The ability to generate exogenous organs in pig for transplantation into humans (xenotransplantation) is\nconsidered as one of the sources to bridge this shortfall. Pigs are already being used for xenotransplantation\nstudies as the size of the animal, organs and physiology are similar to humans. Several tissues from pigs (heart\nvalves, bladder, cornea, etc) are already being used or in advanced stages of product development for\ntransplantation into humans. The main goal of our Company is to generate human liver from donor patient-\nspecific cells using pig as a bio-incubator. Following technical validation, this will provide a pathway for\ngenerating an “on-demand” source of transplantation ready hepatocytes for cellular therapies and will plug-in\ninto the associated technologies such as organ-on- chips, 3D- printing, and pharmaceutical applications in the\nshort-term. In the long-term, the goal is to generate immune-compatible transplantation ready solid organs for\ntransplantation.",

    "abstract_text": "ABSTRACT\nThis proposal by Kuria Therapeutics seeks to conduct IND-enabling studies of KTX-1161, a topical eye drop\nintended to protect corneal endothelial cells (CECs) during cataract surgery and to treat Fuchs’ endothelial\ncorneal dystrophy. KTX-1161 contains the active ingredient SCO-116 which is a proprietary small molecule that\nactivates NRF2. NRF2 is a transcription factor that initiates protective cellular defense systems against oxidative\nstress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and inflammation. The KTX-1161 eye drop should act to protect against the\noxidative insult from phacoemulsification and the chronic oxidative stress inherent to Fuchs’ dystrophy.\nThree Specific Aims in this proposal will achieve the overall goal of completing the IND-enabling nonclinical\nrequirements in preparation for first clinical studies of KTX-1161. In Phase I, Aim 1 is to conduct the GLP\ngenotoxicity study package typically required by FDA for small molecules. Studies include the Ames test, in vitro\nchromosome aberration assay, and an in vivo micronucleus test in rats to determine the genetic toxicity potential\nof SCO-116. In Phase II, Aim 2 includes conduct of the FDA-required GLP safety pharmacology program, an\nocular pharmacokinetic study, and the typical GLP oral and ocular toxicology studies. For safety pharmacology,\na rat respiratory study and hERG test will be performed. A rabbit ocular PK study was specifically requested by\nFDA and will be done. The rat oral and dog ocular toxicology studies will be the normal 28-day toxicology designs\nwith the addition of detailed observations to the rat oral study as requested by FDA during a 2023 pre-IND\nmeeting. Aim 3 comprises the writing of the nonclinical section of the IND which will include the nonclinical study\nreports supporting SCO-116 safety and efficacy and the written and tabulated summaries.\nCEC loss occurs in virtually all of the ~4 million cataract surgeries done each year in the US, with about half a\nmillion patients experiencing excessive CEC loss. With KTX-1161, Kuria aspires to reduce the number of\nexcessive CEC losses and reduce the magnitude of average CEC loss, protecting the future vision of all patients.",

    "abstract_text": "Dry Eye Disease (DED) affects 20% of the global adult population, with higher rates in developed countries like\nthe USA. It significantly impacts quality of life, productivity, increases healthcare costs, and can lead to vision\nloss if untreated. Current therapies are incapable of addressing chronic DED as they cannot be used long-term\ndue to their toxicity. Our innovative First-In-Class mitochondrial technology targets the root cause of DED by\naddressing oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction, which induces Meibomian Gland Dysfunction (MGD),\na predominant cause of DED. Due to its unique mechanism of action, our drug candidate is safe for long-term\nuse and offers a broader therapeutic window. This noninvasive treatment promises to revolutionize eye care and\nprovide a sustainable solution to this widespread health challenge.\nOur proprietary small molecule lead candidate exhibits dose dependent free radical scavenging potential with\ncalculated IC50 of 2.1µM and was found to protect various ocular cell lines against oxidative stress. It was found\nto be highly efficacious in reducing Benzalkonium chloride induced dry eye, tissue damage and vascularization\nin mice model of dry eye. An ophthalmic safety study suggests that an acute TID dose of our candidate as eye\ndrops up to 30 µg/eye (total dose of 90 µg/eye/day) was well tolerated in New Zealand White rabbits.\nWe have secured our invention by the filing of patent applications in the USA (US2021163159081), China\n(CN2280008594), India (IN202317001652), Canada (CA3205099A1), EU (EP22767950.3), Brazil (BR\n1120230181097), Australia (AUS 2022234307) and Japan (JP2023-555226) for compounds, compositions, and\ntheir method of use. The novelty of our invention is confirmed by a written opinion from USPTO and an enhanced\nfreedom to operate searches by qualified patent attorneys.\nDED is a multifactorial indication; therefore, in proposed SBIR phase I, our proposed studies entail In vivo\ncharacterization of lead candidates in desiccating stress/scopolamine (DSS) model of DED in mice working\nthrough varied etiologies. We also propose to evaluate the toxicity of our lead in repeated dose 7-day rabbit\nmodel of toxicity with PK parameters and local biodistribution in eye tissues of rabbits. Successful completion of\nproposed studies will be followed by submission of a phase-II SBIR to conduct a set of IND-enabling pre-clinical\nstudies, manufacturing process scaleup and development, and analytical method validation, GLP toxicity studies\nwith recovery group. Setup of in-house eCTD software interface and electronic submission gateway (ESG) with\nFDA and relevant certifications of personnel and workstation infrastructure will also be included in the SBIR\nphase-II application. We have assembled an experienced team consisting of chemists, drug discovery and bench\nto bedside drug product development experts, pharmacologists, ocular pharmacokinetics, toxicologists,\nophthalmologists, regulatory experts, and industry partners. We are confident of successfully completing the\nproposed work.",

    "abstract_text": "Project Abstract\nIn the U.S., about 850,000 vertebral compression fracture cases are reported annually, with Medicare-related\nexpenses estimated at $250 million. These fractures are particularly common in individuals with osteoporosis\nand have a significant impact on the aging population. Compression fractures affect 20% of those over the age\nof 70. Traditionally, these fractures are conservatively treated with pain management or surgically treated with\nminimally invasive vertebral augmentation procedures involving the injection of polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA)\ninto the vertebrae. Vertebral augmentation has shown benefits in vertebral stabilization, leading to significant\npain relief and improved quality of life in up to 90% of treated patients.\nHowever, the use of PMMA in spinal surgeries has raised concerns due to its potential short-term and long-term\ncomplications. These include thermal necrosis of adjacent bone tissue, risk of fractures in adjacent vertebrae,\nand difficulties in revision surgeries due to PMMA's stiffness and lack of biodegradability. Most notably, cement\nleakage, or extravasation, has been reported in up to 75% of cases, leading to serious complications like\npulmonary embolisms in up to 23% of patients. Consequently, the prevalence of these procedures has\ndecreased by more than 70% since the emergence of these risks, leading to a decline in surgical interventions\nfor osteoporotic spine fractures after 2009. This situation underscores the need for safer, more effective\ntreatments for spinal fractures in vulnerable populations.\nTo address this problem, RevBio has developed Tetranite® (TN), a novel mineral-organic bone adhesive that\ncan fill gaps in bone, bond bone fragments together, adhere metal to bone, and accelerate healing through its\nosteoconductive effects. TN’s proven percutaneous injectability, low exothermal temperature, biodegradability,\nintrinsic mechanical strength, regenerative capabilities, and lack of toxicity make it a good candidate for replacing\nPMMA to treat elderly patients with vertebral fractures. There is no other material on the market to address unmet\nneeds in the orthopaedic space of vertebral fractures for the aging U.S. population.\nThe results from the summative user handling cadaver study (Aim 1) and the pivotal large animal study (Aim 2)\nwill be submitted to FDA in an IDE application to initiate clinical studies. Long term, RevBio's mission is to\ncommercialize TN to revolutionize approaches to minimally invasive spinal care, especially for aging patients\nwith osteoporosis or poor bone quality. We aim to offer surgeons and patients a safer, more effective alternative\ntreatment that is designed to reduce pain, accelerate return to function, and significantly decrease the\ncomplication rates associated with current vertebral fracture procedures.",

This\nproject will demonstrate that Tetranite®—a novel bone adhesive that can be administered percutaneously using\nimage-guidance during surgery—can be used in a safe and effective manner to treat vertebral compression\nfractures using minimally invasive approaches in a large animal model and a surgeon-led human cadaver\nbiomechanical study to ultimately gain regulatory approval as a commercial product.",

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nCancer is the second leading cause of death in the United States with metastatic cancers accounting for 70-90%\nof all cancer fatalities. Lung cancer represents the most prevalent cancer type as well as the deadliest,\naccounting for approximately 20% of all cancer-related deaths. Despite recent advances in novel molecularly\ntargeted therapeutic modalities, including antibody-drug conjugates, cell therapies, and immune checkpoint\ninhibitors, many lung cancer patients fail to benefit from these treatments and urgently require new therapeutic\noptions, particularly for addressing disseminated metastatic disease. In contrast to targeting cell surface antigens\non tumor cells or other cell types, Matrisome Bio is developing targeted therapeutics specific for disease-related\ncomponents of the extracellular matrix (ECM), circumventing the need to reach tumor cells to facilitate drug\ndelivery and internalization. Some ECM targets present advantages over cellular targets due to the ECM’s high\nabundance, its expression across various cancer types and stages of disease, including both early and advanced\ntumors, and its slow turnover, which enables extended retention of ECM-targeted therapeutics at disease sites.\nResearch conducted prior to the founding of Matrisome Bio identified several proteins preferentially expressed\nin the ECM of lung tumors and metastases. Matrisome Bio is developing molecularly targeted drugs based on a\nsuite of nanobodies that specifically target disease-associated ECM proteins that are highly expressed in lung\ncancer and other cancer indications and minimally expressed in normal healthy organs. Published research from\nMatrisome Bio’s founders demonstrates that ECM-specific nanobodies can effectively deliver various payloads\nin mouse models of solid tumors and metastatic disease. The efforts outlined in this grant aim to build upon these\nstudies by developing a theranostic radiopharmaceutical targeted to an ECM component that we have identified,\nwhich is expressed in over 90% of lung tumors and metastases, and which we believe holds the potential to\ntransform the treatment of advanced lung cancer. This Direct to Phase II SBIR application aims to (1) develop\nrefined binder molecules facilitating optimized biodistribution and tumor uptake behavior, characterize target\nbinding kinetics, and optimize preclinical-scale radiolabeling formulations; (2) characterize in vivo biodistribution\nand clearance kinetics of select binders and determine tolerability in a dose escalation study in preclinical models\nof lung cancer; and (3) evaluate preclinical efficacy, safety, and toxicity of lead binder molecules as well as\nconduct a pre-IND meeting with FDA. This project aims to demonstrate the feasibility of developing and\noptimizing ECM-targeting theranostic radiopharmaceuticals with characteristics suitable for effective use in the\ndiagnosis and treatment of advanced lung cancer in humans.",

    "phr_text": "PROJECT NARRATIVE\nLung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths, with the majority of patients failing to respond\nadequately to currently available therapies and most often succumbing to metastatic disease within a few years\nof diagnosis. To address this major unmet clinical need, Matrisome Bio is developing innovative theranostic\nradiopharmaceuticals that target disease-specific components of the extracellular matrix surrounding tumor cells,\nand which are broadly expressed in primary tumors and metastases of lung cancer patients. This approach\nleverages a previously underexplored opportunity for targeted cancer therapies that can be applied for both\nimaging and therapy of advanced lung cancers to bring novel and efficacious treatments to patients.",

    "abstract_text": "Project Summary\nCoupling high-throughput omics technologies with machine learning and the phenotypic-based drug discovery\nparadigm allows for data-driven drug discovery (D4). D4 has the advantage of being unbiased, like phenotypic-\nbased drug discovery, but the comprehensive measurements of 100s to 100,000s of biological features also\nenables characterizing drug perturbations and disease signatures to gain mechanistic insights. The predominant\ndata type for D4 has been transcriptomics and more recently image-based assays. Other biomolecules (i.e.,\nproteins and metabolites) are considered closer to the phenotype, however technical challenges in data\ngeneration and analysis, as well as the lack of standardized data analysis pipelines have limited the systematic\nuse of these data types. Sinopia Bioscience and Omix Technologies have combined their strengths in systems\nbiology data analysis, AI/ML, and LC-MS/MS based metabolomics to develop a unique metabolomics-based\nplatform that has allowed for systematic metabolic characterization of a chemical library consisting of ~3,300\nsmall molecules covering more than 1,000 drug targets. Our preliminary results demonstrate that metabolomics\nis more sensitive, reproducible, and predictive of the mechanism of action of these small molecules than\ntranscriptomics. Further, we found that using metabolomics data we could predict cell line specific toxicity of\ncancer drugs in viability assays. Importantly, we found we could derive metabolic signatures of sensitivity and\nresistance and use these to identify secondary compounds that can enhance sensitivity to cancer drugs. In this\nPhase I proposal, we will expand on these findings and develop novel algorithms to better understand how\nbaseline metabolic states of cancers affect their sensitivity to cancer drugs. As a development test case we will\nfocus on sensitivity of breast cancer cell lines to docetaxel and tucatinib. First, we will perform high throughput\nmetabolomics and analysis of 100 cancer cell lines to characterize metabolism both in a baseline state and after\nadministration of docetaxel and tucatinib. Second, we will develop novel computational algorithms for predicting\nthe ability of compounds to sensitize cancer cells to cancer drugs. Finally, we will experimentally validate novel\ncompound combinations and generate metabolomics data to further improve our algorithms. Success of this\nPhase I proposal will lead to validated metabolomics-based methods for identifying underlying metabolic\nphenotypes predictive of drug sensitivity, which will then be leveraged to predict the effects of compound\ncombinations. This allows us to further expand Sinopia’s platform’s capabilities and its application to oncology\napplications through partnerships with biotech/pharma and/or fundraising through outside investors. In addition,\nit would lead to novel use of targets and compounds to enhance the sensitivity to existing cancer treatments that\nwe can internally develop. Phase II will focus on further development of the platform, expanding our\nmetabolomics-based library, and advancing promising synergistic combinations into preclinical models.",

    "abstract_text": "Spheroids and organoids are self-assembled, multicellular, 3D structures that better mimic in vivo tissues than\n2D cell cultures. They have become an indispensable in vitro tool for processes such as drug assays, disease\nmodeling, and for mechanistic studies. The secretion of specific factors by spheroids and organoids is vital for\naccurate recapitulation of in vivo function. Methods to measure secretion from these in vitro systems are indirect,\nslow, laborious, and combine many spheroids / organoids together masking the dynamics of secretion from the\nindividuals. In this proposal, we will develop technology that will enable online measurement of secretion\ndynamics from many individual spheroids or organoids in parallel. To accomplish this work, we will perform the\nfollowing specific aims. In aim 1, a centrifugal system will be developed to deliver a continuous flow of perfusion\nsolution to spheroids / organoids as well as immunoassay assay reagents specific for the secreted factor of\ninterest. These solutions will be delivered via centrifugal pumping to a mixing channel where fluorescence\nanisotropy will be used to quantify the secreted factor as the device spins. The spinning system and fluorescence\nanisotropy system will be fully optimized. In aim 2, this system will be applied to several model spheroid systems\nfor validation of the technology. The system will enable quantitative measurement of secretory function multiple\ntimes per second from each organoid, making a significant and vertical advance compared to current technology.\nWe anticipate the new technology will be a powerful tool in the field of spheroid and organoid research.",

    "abstract_text": "SUMMARY\nMeasuring immunospecific binding of target nucleic acids (NA) to single stranded DNA (ssDNA) probes\nimmobilized on solid surface has revolutionized molecular biology analysis from basic science to medicine.\nHowever, microarray-based technologies including Next Generation Sequencing can detect mutations with high\nprecision but have limited ability to quantify copy numbers. The gold standard for NA quantification, qPCR is\nlimited to meet the current need to quantify small NA, such as miRNA at required sensitivity in attomolar (aM)\nrange for applications such as liquid biopsy for diagnosis and prognosis. Label-free, enzyme-free electro-\nchemical approaches, particularly Electrochemical Beacon (EcB) is a promising technology to make microarray\nquantitative. However, the limit of quantification (LOQ) is only ~10 pM due to the complexity of the probe design\nwhich is a folded structure with complex conformation. In the proposed EcB study a simple binary probe is\ndesigned comprising of short reporter DNA (R) tethered to the electrode with longer probe (P) complimentary to\nthe target (T) of interest. The R has a redox active dye, methylene blue (MB) tethered to the free-end. On P-T\nbinding the released R brings MB in proximity to the electrode resulting in a signal. The research strategy is to\ndesign an R-P probe such that there is no signal from the binary probe and a signal is generated on each P-T\nbinding, i.e., positive contrast. The background is well controlled to have low false positives and negatives. The\ngoal is to use a special opto-electrochemical tool called SEED to read P-T binding to a microarray of binary\nprobes on a monolith electrode by measuring local redox on 10 micron spots to obtain LOQ of 10 attomolars\nwith dynamic range of over seven orders of magnitude to profile a mixture of ~25 miRNA sequences on a chip.\nThe premise is based on previously published result showing SEED has the required sensitivity. The study will\nbe organized in two specific aims: Specific Aim 1: Binary Probe design verification. The goal will be to, (a) create\na “perfect switch” where before binding all (R-P) probes show no signal and, on each P-T binding the released\nR contributes to a redox signal. and (b) establish calibration curves to quantify mixtures of up to 25 synthetic\nssRNA (or analogous ssDNA) targets with background of non-specific NAs. Specific Aim 2: Validation of binary\nprobe design. The goal will be to quantify ~25 miRNA in cell line and exosomes suspended in its media. The\ncells will be cultured with/without UV exposure. The success will be a quantitative profile of ~25 miRNA\nsequences in biological sample with [c] ranging from ~10 aM to ~1 nM. On success, collaborations will be initiated\nto translate the application to 3D culture (organoid/spheroid), stem cell differentiation and liquid biopsy\napplications.",

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nThe mass production of tissues and organs is the ultimate goal of biomanufacturing, but this goal will not be\nachieved without the assistance of engineering design tools that predict how three-dimensional, multicellular\nstructures, comprised of cells that dynamically respond to each other and their environment, self-organize into\nspatially patterned tissues. To date, no such design tools exist, and our high-risk, high-reward proposal seeks\nto develop and validate the first multiscale computational model to inform the design, fabrication, and self-\nassembly of tissues comprised of heterogeneous cell types engineered with synthetic gene circuits regulating\ncell adhesion. We recently published a relatively simple agent-based computational model, that when coupled\nwith machine learning algorithms, identifies design parameters that generate multicell spheroids, or simple\ntissues, comprised of heterogeneous subpopulations of cells that self-organize into specific patterns (e.g.,\nstriped, soccer ball, core/shell, and core/pole). The proposed work will greatly elaborate this simple model to a\nmultiscale computational model to predict how collections of bioprinted spheroids form into spatially patterned\n“assembloids.” We will utilize mixed populations of two cell types genetically engineered with highly modular\nsynNotch synthetic gene circuits, which propagate intracellular signals to regulate cell-cell adhesion strength\nbased on cell-cell interactions. We will also leverage state-of-the-art 3D printing spheroid positioning\ntechnology developed at our institution to precisely place three-dimensional spheroids adjacent to one another\nwithin a synthetic biomaterial that facilitates the formation of engineered tissue constructs. In Aim 1, we will\ndevelop a novel multiscale agent-based computational model that predicts how synNotch-mediated\nintercellular signaling and intracellular signaling in individual cells gives rise to self-sorting of heterogeneous\ncell populations, leading to the emergent patterning of three-dimensional tissues. We will run tens of thousands\nof simulations and apply clustering algorithms to extract design parameters that favor certain three-dimensional\ntissue patterns over others. In Aim 2, we will experimentally validate that the computational model can be\nreliably used to design three-dimensional multicellular tissue constructs by challenging it to identify the design\nparameters (e.g., initial number of cells, ratio of cell subpopulations, heterotypic and homotypic cell-cell\nadhesion strengths) that will generate three-dimensional assembloids with specific multicellular patterns. We\nwill culture synNotch cells into spheroids and spatially position them into tissue assembloids according to the\ndesign parameters predicted by the computer model, and then we will assess if the experimental tissues,\nimaged using confocal microscopy, exhibit the spatial patterns predicted by the computational model. We\nexpect that our project, which tightly integrates computational modeling with experiments, will significantly\nadvance the fields of three-dimensional bioprinting, biomanufacturing, and multiscale computational modeling\nof multicellular tissues and enable the robust generation of complex tissue structures by design.",

    "abstract_text": "PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT\nOur goal is to understand how the lung microbiome regulates influenza virus infection response by developing a\n3D in vitro bioprinted platform to study host-microbiome-influenza interactions in the lung alveolar space. The\nrespiratory microbiome, encompassing hundreds of different bacterial and fungal species, has essential roles in\nthe development of tissue-specific immunity and colonization resistance to pathogens, including viral infection.\nThe lung and alveolar space undergo constant microbial exposure from the inhalation of oropharyngeal contents.\nNotably, sequencing-based studies have identified a low biomass but diverse microbial signature in healthy\nindividuals. However, a detailed mechanistic understanding of how these diverse microbes interact with host\ncells to maintain lung health and contribute to viral infection susceptibility is currently lacking. Major knowledge\ngaps exist due to 1) the substantial biodiversity of the lung microbiome, 2) difficulties in modeling the complexity\nof the human lung environment, and 3) limited information about where in the lung epithelium these interactions\ntake place and what are the cell-type specific host responses. Additionally, Current approaches lack the capacity\nto model host-microbe interactions in the lung at transcriptional and spatial resolution. We will overcome these\nlimitations by developing two new technologies – a 3D bioprinted alveolar sac model and dual host-microbe\nspatial transcriptomics (ST) – to enhance our understanding of the host response to microbial colonization in an\nadvanced, anatomically relevant lung model. The ability to examine which and how specific microbes interact\nwith the lung epithelium and the effect these interactions on influenza infection would be valuable to investigate\nthe microbiome’s role in lung health and infection response. In Aim 1, we will develop and characterize a 3D\nbioprinted ventilated alveolar sac model. We will then evaluate its influenza infection response using ST and\nsingle-cell RNA-sequencing. In Aim 2, we will examine how diverse respiratory microbiota condition the alveolar\nepithelium to affect influenza infection response. We will develop a dual ST method to simultaneously profile\nhost transcriptional response and microbial/viral localization. We will then use this method to examine how\nmicrobial conditioning of the epithelium affects influenza infection dynamics. Together, these aims will allow us\nto address fundamental questions on the underlying biology of the lung microbiome and its effect on influenza\nresponse. Our success would result in two new technologies facilitating the construction of a high-resolution\nspatial map of the microbiome-host interactions. This advancement would enable in-depth investigations into the\nmechanisms of interstrain interactions, virulence regulation, and their impact on lung immune homeostasis and\ninfection response.",

    "abstract_text": "Project Summary\n Tissue engineered vascular conduits (TEVCs) offer high potential for treating cardiovascular diseases,\nsuch as single ventricle defects, by repairing damaged tissues and improving circulation. Conduits made of\nrealistic tissue components present as long-lasting solutions capable of adapting with the body and integrating\nwith host cells, thus offering enhanced, physiologically mimicking functionality. Bioprinting is an enabling\napproach toward generating user-designable tissues, with potential for maximizing accommodation for patient-\nspecific needs. However, current bioprinting techniques are restricted in the types of materials that can be used\nas bioinks, typically relying on artificial materials/modifiers in bioink solutions or extremely high concentrations\nand acidity to enable printability, which limit biocompatibility and versatility. Many natural, physiological materials\nremain unprintable, especially with direct inclusion of cells within the bioinks. Moreover, key limitations in existing\nTEVCs (which are typically not bioprinted) include high incidence of stenosis in patients, thus elevating the risks\nof utilizing such products as the clinical gold standard.\n In this proposed study, we will develop highly tunable and customizable TEVCs utilizing a novel\nbioprinting method capable of directly printing fully physiological materials, including cell-laden tissues. Our\nmethod is fast, enabling rapid production of TEVCs with custom features. We will further incorporate universal\nimmunocompatible human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived cells, including endothelial cells, in our\nbioprinted TEVCs to generate highly biomimicking living vessels with a functional endothelium, which will be\nconditioned and matured to enhance vessel function prior to implantation experiments. Matured TEVCs will\nsubsequently be implanted in vivo into humanized rats to evaluate performance enhancements. Our study will\nproduce a new generation of TEVCs with significantly enriched functions – custom bioprinted,\nimmunocompatible living vessels for personalized and off-the-shelf capable regenerative therapeutic\napplications. We aim to develop fundamental advances in tissue engineered vessels for treating single ventricle\ndefects.",
