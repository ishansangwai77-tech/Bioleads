    "title": "Three-Dimensional Liver Culture Systems to Maintain Primary Hepatic Properties for Toxicological Analysis In Vitro.",
    "abstract": "Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is the major reason for failures in drug development and withdrawal of approved drugs from the market. Two-dimensional cultures of hepatocytes often fail to reliably predict DILI: hepatoma cell lines such as HepG2 do not reflect important primary-like hepatic properties and primary human hepatocytes (pHHs) dedifferentiate quickly in vitro and are, therefore, not suitable for long-term toxicity studies. More predictive liver in vitro models are urgently required in drug development and compound safety evaluation. This review discusses available human hepatic cell types for in vitro toxicology analysis and their usage in established and emerging three-dimensional (3D) culture systems. Generally, 3D cultures maintain or improve primary hepatic functions (including expression of drug-metabolizing enzymes) of different liver cells for several weeks of culture, thus allowing long-term and repeated-dose toxicity studies. Spheroid cultures of pHHs have been comprehensively tested, but also other cell types such as HepaRG benefit from 3D culture systems. Emerging 3D culture techniques include usage of induced pluripotent stem-cell-derived hepatocytes and primary-like upcyte cells, as well as advanced culture techniques such as microfluidic liver-on-a-chip models. In-depth characterization of existing and emerging 3D hepatocyte technologies is indispensable for successful implementation of such systems in toxicological analysis.",

    "abstract": "Cannabidiol (CBD) and valproate (VPA) are anti-epileptic medications commonly co-prescribed to treat seizures due to Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, Dravet syndrome, and tuberous sclerosis complex in children. Clinical trial data have demonstrated that CBD carries a risk for severe hepatotoxicity that is greatly increased when prescribed with VPA through an unknown mechanism. The aim of this study was to investigate CBD-induced liver injury in combination with VPA using an in vitro liver model. Three-dimensional human hepatocyte spheroids are an emerging in vitro system that allows investigation of long-term toxicity. Spheroids derived from primary human hepatocytes were treated with vehicle control, 2-200 μM CBD, 0.5-20 mM VPA, CBD + VPA, and 0.1-10 mM acetaminophen (positive control). After 24 h, 8 days, and 15 days of exposure, spheroids were analyzed for ATP depletion, urea production, and CBD and VPA metabolite generation. Untargeted metabolomic analysis was also conducted. A delayed-onset, dose-dependent hepatotoxicity was observed in spheroids exposed to each drug treatment compared to vehicle control. This study is the first to recapitulate the hepatotoxic drug interaction of CBD and VPA in vitro and demonstrates the utility of human hepatocyte spheroids for toxicity studies. Future work is needed to examine mechanisms of CBD-induced hepatotoxicity with VPA.",

    "abstract": "While alternative methods for toxicity testing using re-constructed human skin and cornea have been written into guidelines and adopted by regulatory authorities, three-dimensional (3D) liver models are currently applied in the industrial settings for hepatotoxicity screening and prediction. These 3D liver models can recapitulate the architecture, functionality and toxicity response of the native liver, demonstrated by a set of related hallmarks. In this comprehensive review, non-scaffold and scaffold-based methods available for 3D liver model formation are introduced, with an emphasis on their advantages and drawbacks. We then focus on the characteristics of primary human hepatocytes, stem cell derived hepatocyte like cells, and immortalized hepatic cell lines as cell resources for model reconstruction. Primary hepatocytes are generally regarded to be superior to other cell types due to their comparable metabolic profiles to the native liver. Additionally, the application of 3D liver models (mostly liver spheroids) on the evaluation of drug induced liver injury and chronic liver diseases (steatosis, cirrhosis, cholestasis), as well as the potential of nanomaterials to introduce hepatotoxicity are summarized. Finally, the global 3D cell market from 3D liver model manufacturing to the contract service of ",
