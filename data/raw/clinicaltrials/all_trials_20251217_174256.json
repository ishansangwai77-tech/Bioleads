        "briefSummary": "Study Goal:\n\nThis pilot study wants to find out if using a menstrual cup can be a good, non-invasive way to collect samples from the lining of the uterus (called the endometrium) to help screen for endometrial cancer. This is especially important for women who have a higher chance of getting this cancer, such as those with a genetic condition called Lynch syndrome.\n\nMain Questions the Study Will Answer:\n\n1. Can a menstrual cup collect enough uterine lining (endometrial tissue) for doctors to examine under a microscope?\n2. Are the samples from the menstrual cup as useful for diagnosis as samples taken using the usual method (called an endometrial biopsy or EMB)?\n3. Is using a menstrual cup at home easy, effective, and comfortable for participants?\n4. Can scientists grow small lab models of the uterus (called organoids) from the menstrual cup samples and from biopsy samples?\n\nWhat Will Happen in the Study:\n\n* Participants will use a menstrual cup at home to collect menstrual blood.\n* They will also have a standard endometrial biopsy done by a healthcare provider.\n* After both collections, participants will fill out a short survey about how comfortable and easy it was to use the menstrual cup.\n\nWhat the Study Will Measure:\n\n* Feasibility: How well participants are able to use the menstrual cup and send in the sample.\n* Sample Quality: Whether the menstrual cup collects enough good-quality tissue for testing, and how it compares to biopsy samples.\n* Participant Experience: How women feel about using the menstrual cup, based on the survey.\n* Lab Testing: Whether researchers can successfully grow endometrial organoids from both types of samples.\n\nWhy This Study Matters: If this method works, it could offer a gentler, more convenient way for women to get checked for endometrial cancer-especially those who need regular screening. It could also make it easier to collect samples for research and improve early detection of cancer."

Biopsies will be collected using the minimally invasive percutaneous needle microbiopsy technique, suitable for collecting repeated samples over time in the same individual while still leading to sufficient tissue of good quality for subsequent analysis1,2. For the children with CP, the local hospital's tradition of applying general anesthesia for delivering BTX injections will be exploited to collect the muscle samples prior to the BTX session and the one-year follow-up, or general anesthesia planned for orthopedic surgery or diagnostic imaging such as MRI, etc. For the collection of the samples 3 months before the BTX session, as well as 3 months and 6 months after BTX injections, the common approach for microbiospy collection will be applied, with local sedation on the skin (Rapydan©) and fascia (Xylocaine©) and local anesthesia by using Kalinox© (nitrous oxide in oxygen) under supervision of the University Hospital PROSA team. Biopsies of TD muscles will be collected in children with no history of neurological disorder, nor musculoskeletal problems at the level of the gastrocnemius or semitendinosus, at the time of upper limb orthopedic or trauma surgery and thus always under general anesthesia. Ultrasound guided percutaneous muscle biopsy has been performed in children (2 months-18 years)3,4 and has proven to be safe and well-tolerated. A pilot study (S61110) was conducted to confirm that the microbiopsy technique is suitable for the analysis of microscopic muscle properties and is well-tolerated in children with CP.\n\nTwo specific research goals are planned, with hypotheses emerging from literature."

        "briefSummary": "Post-infection chronic fatigue syndromes, such as myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) and post-COVID-19 condition (Long Covid), are conditions primarily characterized by debilitating fatigue. This fatigue can range from mild, where patients are still able to participate in some social activities (e.g., school, work), to moderate and severe, where sufferers are predominantly homebound and bedridden. As a result, ME/CFS and Long Covid not only negatively impact the quality of life of affected individuals and their caregivers but also represent a substantial and often silent burden on healthcare systems worldwide, including Austria. This is primarily because most cases remain undiagnosed due to the lack of standardized clinical assessments and diagnostic markers. Endothelial dysfunction, which is well known to affect blood flow, oxygen and nutrient delivery, and waste removal in the body, has been described as one of the key factors behind the symptoms experienced by ME/CFS and Long Covid patients. However, the mechanisms that might explain the development of endothelial dysfunction remain largely unexplored. Therefore, this project aims to evaluate key biological aspects related to the function of endothelial cells - a layer of cells lining blood vessels - using plasma samples from an Austrian cohort of ME/CFS and Long Covid patients. We expect that the findings from our study will provide new insights to better understand endothelial dysfunction in post-infection chronic fatigue syndromes, leading to improved patient stratification and tailored treatment alternatives."

        "briefSummary": "Almost 85% of new therapeutic molecules are abandoned before the clinical trial stage. Most of these failures currently concern cancer therapies.\n\nIn order to optimize the development of these molecules and allow the development of precision medicine, an innovative screening device that is as close as possible to in vivo is necessary.\n\nFor this reason, the platform the investigators are setting up takes into account tumor vascularization as well as the 3D microenvironment.\n\nThe platform the investigators intend to set up is based on 4 cornerstones:\n\n* the formation of patient-derived organoids seems to be the best option to take into account the microenvironment and cellular interactions.\n* the vascular network: the formation of a peri-tumoral vascular network, either by using HUVECS cells or by using endothelial cells from the patient.\n* the extracellular matrix, and the set of proteins it contains, is a major element of in vivo interaction. Moreover, the presence of a matrix is a key element for the development of vascularization in vitro.\n* Functional tumor microenvironment: peri-tumor vascularization is necessary but not sufficient to claim to recreate a tumor microenvironment. It must be functionalized, and this implies the use of a microfluidic system.\n\nThis ready-to-use platform will be used on tumor biopsies of the patient, to constitute a tool for personalized medicine. This could even be a future component of decision at multidisciplinary board meetings.\n\nThe main objective of our research is the constitution of organoids derived from the patient in order to select, via a screening device, the best anti-tumor therapy to administer to the patient.\n\nA secondary objective is to collect lymphocytes from the patient's blood in order to test the effectiveness of therapies mediated by the immune system (immunotherapy)."

        "briefSummary": "Lung or combined heart-lung transplantation represents an established treatment strategy for patients with end-stage lung disease. Transplantation results in an increased exercise capacity, a better quality of life and - depending on the pulmonary disease - a prolonged life compared to the natural course of the pulmonary disease. However, even after successful organ transplantation, patients realise the often inflated, unrealistic character of their previous expectations due to their continuing dependence on medication, regular control examinations and a higher risk of infections and allograft rejections. Patients have to cope with erupting demands in family, social and work life. It becomes evident that their lives have changed forever. In this context, limitations in mental health like depression and reduced quality of life (QoL) as well as diminished compliance may emerge or even persist. By five years post-transplant, about one-half of the patients meet the criteria of an anxiety disorder. Symptoms of a clinically relevant depression or mood disorder occur in 10 to 15 % of lung transplant patients.\n\nIn addition, patients after lung transplantation are often in a poor physical condition and only hold a reduced functional status. Surgery itself, a prolonged weaning period during mechanical ventilation, sepsis, and especially the immunosuppressive medication may long-ranging or permanently limit physical activity, further reducing muscle mass and bodily function.\n\nSome positive effects of either psychological coping skills training or supervised exercise therapy after lung or heart-lung transplantation on QoL and functional status have been described in very few existing pilot studies with small numbers of patients and only short-term follow-up. In addition, although clear evidence points to a mutual amplifying effect of both psychological training and exercise therapy in patients coping with chronic disease, no such study has yet been conducted in the transplantation field.\n\nTherefore, the aim of the investigators randomised controlled study is to prove the differential benefit of a multi-modal resource-activating behavioural training programme combined with an intensified exercise training programme on functional status as well as on QoL in a four-armed design. The investigators hypotheses are: (H1) The multimodal resource-activating behavioural training programme will show better out-comes in the measures of global health-related QoL compared to a relaxation group. (H2) Participants in the intensified anaerobic exercise training will have better outcomes in the measures of exercise-related variables and lung function than the group with moderate aerobic exercise training. (H3) Participants in the behavioural intervention programme and the intensified exercise training will have better outcomes in the measures of global health-related QoL and exercise-related variables compared to the other groups."

        "briefSummary": "Almost 85% of new therapeutic molecules are abandoned before the clinical trial stage. Most of these failures currently concern cancer therapies.\n\nIn order to optimize the development of these molecules and allow the development of precision medicine, an innovative screening device that is as close as possible to in vivo is necessary.\n\nFor this reason, the platform the investigators are setting up takes into account tumor vascularization as well as the 3D microenvironment.\n\nThe platform the investigators intend to set up is based on 4 cornerstones:\n\n* the formation of patient-derived organoids seems to be the best option to take into account the microenvironment and cellular interactions.\n* the vascular network: the formation of a peri-tumoral vascular network, either by using HUVECS cells or by using endothelial cells from the patient.\n* the extracellular matrix, and the set of proteins it contains, is a major element of in vivo interaction. Moreover, the presence of a matrix is a key element for the development of vascularization in vitro.\n* Functional tumor microenvironment: peri-tumor vascularization is necessary but not sufficient to claim to recreate a tumor microenvironment. It must be functionalized, and this implies the use of a microfluidic system.\n\nThis ready-to-use platform will be used on tumor biopsies of the patient, to constitute a tool for personalized medicine. This could even be a future component of decision at multidisciplinary board meetings.\n\nThe main objective of our research is the constitution of organoids derived from the patient in order to select, via a screening device, the best anti-tumor therapy to administer to the patient.\n\nA secondary objective is to collect lymphocytes from the patient's blood in order to test the effectiveness of therapies mediated by the immune system (immunotherapy)."

        "briefSummary": "Organoids are generated from tumor biopsies, taken during a standard procedure. and are a collection of organ-specific cell types that are able to self-organize in-vitro in a manner similar to the in-vivo situation (3D). They have the capability to facilitate in-depth analysis of patient's own tumor material at point of diagnosis and during progressive/recurrent disease. There is currently no published protocol to establish long-term lung cancer organoids from lung cancer patients. Such a methodology would enable the prospective identification of 'patient tailored optimal treatments\" as well as the derivation of predictive biomarkers for response and relapse. Apart from organoids, xenograft models also still have their merits. To generate PDX, tumor material will be retrieved from surgical specimens, cut in small pieces, transplanted in the recipient immune deficient animals either subcutaneously or implanted directly into the lung. A tumor with the median growth rate will be serially transplanted in vivo for further therapeutic experiments. Dedicated small animal irradiaton in our facility enables precise local irradiation of lung tumors with minimal radiation exposure of the surrounding normal tissues. Integrated cone beam computed tomography imaging system allows longitudinal monitoring of tumor response to novel treatments."

        "briefSummary": "Neoadjuvant treatment is an important treatment for early breast cancer patients. Patients with her2 enriched subtype who achieved pCR after neoadjuvant treatment would have longer survival. The neoadjuvant treatment for her2 positive patients include chemotherapy and targeted therapy. Although the pCR rate was high to 60% after use of trastuzumab and pertuzumab, but the adverse reaction of combined chemotherapy could not be negligible. Some studies have attempted chemotherapy-free treatment for her2 positive patients during neoadjuvant therapy. But, which patient could be exempted from chemotherapy and which drug could be omitted are still unknow before treatment. Drug sensitivity screening in vitro was a promising method for choosing chemotherapy. But there was no method could select effective drugs accurately for breast cancer patients until now.\n\nPreviously, investigators developed a patient-derived tumor-like cell clusters in vitro culture technology. Feasibility for guiding clinical treatment by drug sensitivity screening based on this technology have been explored by preliminary exploration with a well corresponding. And the results have been published. This study will explore whether drug screening in vitro patient-derived tumor-like cell clusters from breast cancer tissue could be a metheod for omitting chemotherapy for her2 positive participants."

The new skin test is named C-Tb and like the current Tuberculin a positive test result will show as redness and/or swelling at the injection site, while a negative test will leave no reactions.\n\nThe aim of this study is to test the C-Tb skin test in healthy adults previously BCG vaccinated to determine if healthy non tuberculosis infected individuals has a truly negative test result (this is called determining the specificity of the skin test). To be able to compare the new skin test with the current Tuberculin skin test volunteers will be injected with both the C-Tb and the TST skin test."

Clinical research has shown that drugs that inhibit vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) or epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signalling can increase overall survival in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Preclinical studies have shown that vandetanib (ZD6474) is an inhibitor of both VEGFR and EGFR signalling. Giving vandetanib may therefore inhibit the growth of cancer cells by blocking their blood supply and by stopping them from dividing. This lung cancer study is to investigate if adding vandetanib to Alimta (pemetrexed) is more effective than Alimta (pemetrexed) alone."

Driven by robust data on the benefits of ketogenic diet in epilepsy and by preliminary data in animal models demonstrating its effects on depressive behaviors, there is a hypothesis that ketogenic diet could be useful to treat residual depressive symptoms. As deficits in reward and pleasure (anhedonia) are the most common residual symptoms in MDD individuals with partial response to SSRIs, the ketogenic diet could be a potential adjuvant in the treatment for depression. In addition, a preliminary assessment of neuroplasticity-related biomarkers in the plasma to determine possible biological substrates for the mechanism of action of ketogenic diet in the brain will be conducted."
