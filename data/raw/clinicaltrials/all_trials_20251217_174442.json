        "briefSummary": "Study Goal:\n\nThis pilot study wants to find out if using a menstrual cup can be a good, non-invasive way to collect samples from the lining of the uterus (called the endometrium) to help screen for endometrial cancer. This is especially important for women who have a higher chance of getting this cancer, such as those with a genetic condition called Lynch syndrome.\n\nMain Questions the Study Will Answer:\n\n1. Can a menstrual cup collect enough uterine lining (endometrial tissue) for doctors to examine under a microscope?\n2. Are the samples from the menstrual cup as useful for diagnosis as samples taken using the usual method (called an endometrial biopsy or EMB)?\n3. Is using a menstrual cup at home easy, effective, and comfortable for participants?\n4. Can scientists grow small lab models of the uterus (called organoids) from the menstrual cup samples and from biopsy samples?\n\nWhat Will Happen in the Study:\n\n* Participants will use a menstrual cup at home to collect menstrual blood.\n* They will also have a standard endometrial biopsy done by a healthcare provider.\n* After both collections, participants will fill out a short survey about how comfortable and easy it was to use the menstrual cup.\n\nWhat the Study Will Measure:\n\n* Feasibility: How well participants are able to use the menstrual cup and send in the sample.\n* Sample Quality: Whether the menstrual cup collects enough good-quality tissue for testing, and how it compares to biopsy samples.\n* Participant Experience: How women feel about using the menstrual cup, based on the survey.\n* Lab Testing: Whether researchers can successfully grow endometrial organoids from both types of samples.\n\nWhy This Study Matters: If this method works, it could offer a gentler, more convenient way for women to get checked for endometrial cancer-especially those who need regular screening. It could also make it easier to collect samples for research and improve early detection of cancer."

        "briefSummary": "The focus of this study is to understand and define the mechanisms of the altered muscle development and growth on a microscopic level within a long-term perspective in children with cerebral palsy and to relate these findings to muscle macroscopic properties defined by muscle imaging, to neuromuscular symptoms and to treatment.\n\nThis study aims to (1) evaluate intrinsic microscopic muscle properties of young growing children with CP, and (2) to evaluate these muscle properties in relation to macroscopic properties, neuromuscular symptoms and to treatment.\n\nImproved understanding of changes in microscopic muscle properties, and how they relate to macroscopic properties and to the neuromuscular symptoms as well as how they are influenced by treatment, has the potential to delineate CP phenotypes prone to intervention and to optimize treatment protocols or develop new treatments, leading to new avenues for improving function in CP.\n\nThe method to study microscopic muscle properties involves analysis of muscle biopsies (histological / immunohistochemistry analysis, SC and IC culture, gene expression). Biopsies will be collected using the minimally invasive percutaneous needle microbiopsy technique, suitable for collecting repeated samples over time in the same individual while still leading to sufficient tissue of good quality for subsequent analysis1,2. For the children with CP, the local hospital's tradition of applying general anesthesia for delivering BTX injections will be exploited to collect the muscle samples prior to the BTX session and the one-year follow-up, or general anesthesia planned for orthopedic surgery or diagnostic imaging such as MRI, etc. For the collection of the samples 3 months before the BTX session, as well as 3 months and 6 months after BTX injections, the common approach for microbiospy collection will be applied, with local sedation on the skin (Rapydan©) and fascia (Xylocaine©) and local anesthesia by using Kalinox© (nitrous oxide in oxygen) under supervision of the University Hospital PROSA team. Biopsies of TD muscles will be collected in children with no history of neurological disorder, nor musculoskeletal problems at the level of the gastrocnemius or semitendinosus, at the time of upper limb orthopedic or trauma surgery and thus always under general anesthesia. Ultrasound guided percutaneous muscle biopsy has been performed in children (2 months-18 years)3,4 and has proven to be safe and well-tolerated. A pilot study (S61110) was conducted to confirm that the microbiopsy technique is suitable for the analysis of microscopic muscle properties and is well-tolerated in children with CP.\n\nTwo specific research goals are planned, with hypotheses emerging from literature."

        "briefSummary": "Almost 85% of new therapeutic molecules are abandoned before the clinical trial stage. Most of these failures currently concern cancer therapies.\n\nIn order to optimize the development of these molecules and allow the development of precision medicine, an innovative screening device that is as close as possible to in vivo is necessary.\n\nFor this reason, the platform the investigators are setting up takes into account tumor vascularization as well as the 3D microenvironment.\n\nThe platform the investigators intend to set up is based on 4 cornerstones:\n\n* the formation of patient-derived organoids seems to be the best option to take into account the microenvironment and cellular interactions.\n* the vascular network: the formation of a peri-tumoral vascular network, either by using HUVECS cells or by using endothelial cells from the patient.\n* the extracellular matrix, and the set of proteins it contains, is a major element of in vivo interaction. Moreover, the presence of a matrix is a key element for the development of vascularization in vitro.\n* Functional tumor microenvironment: peri-tumor vascularization is necessary but not sufficient to claim to recreate a tumor microenvironment. It must be functionalized, and this implies the use of a microfluidic system.\n\nThis ready-to-use platform will be used on tumor biopsies of the patient, to constitute a tool for personalized medicine. This could even be a future component of decision at multidisciplinary board meetings.\n\nThe main objective of our research is the constitution of organoids derived from the patient in order to select, via a screening device, the best anti-tumor therapy to administer to the patient.\n\nA secondary objective is to collect lymphocytes from the patient's blood in order to test the effectiveness of therapies mediated by the immune system (immunotherapy)."

        "briefSummary": "Organoids are generated from tumor biopsies, taken during a standard procedure. and are a collection of organ-specific cell types that are able to self-organize in-vitro in a manner similar to the in-vivo situation (3D). They have the capability to facilitate in-depth analysis of patient's own tumor material at point of diagnosis and during progressive/recurrent disease. There is currently no published protocol to establish long-term lung cancer organoids from lung cancer patients. Such a methodology would enable the prospective identification of 'patient tailored optimal treatments\" as well as the derivation of predictive biomarkers for response and relapse. Apart from organoids, xenograft models also still have their merits. To generate PDX, tumor material will be retrieved from surgical specimens, cut in small pieces, transplanted in the recipient immune deficient animals either subcutaneously or implanted directly into the lung. A tumor with the median growth rate will be serially transplanted in vivo for further therapeutic experiments. Dedicated small animal irradiaton in our facility enables precise local irradiation of lung tumors with minimal radiation exposure of the surrounding normal tissues. Integrated cone beam computed tomography imaging system allows longitudinal monitoring of tumor response to novel treatments."

        "briefSummary": "Neoadjuvant treatment is an important treatment for early breast cancer patients. Patients with her2 enriched subtype who achieved pCR after neoadjuvant treatment would have longer survival. The neoadjuvant treatment for her2 positive patients include chemotherapy and targeted therapy. Although the pCR rate was high to 60% after use of trastuzumab and pertuzumab, but the adverse reaction of combined chemotherapy could not be negligible. Some studies have attempted chemotherapy-free treatment for her2 positive patients during neoadjuvant therapy. But, which patient could be exempted from chemotherapy and which drug could be omitted are still unknow before treatment. Drug sensitivity screening in vitro was a promising method for choosing chemotherapy. But there was no method could select effective drugs accurately for breast cancer patients until now.\n\nPreviously, investigators developed a patient-derived tumor-like cell clusters in vitro culture technology. Feasibility for guiding clinical treatment by drug sensitivity screening based on this technology have been explored by preliminary exploration with a well corresponding. And the results have been published. This study will explore whether drug screening in vitro patient-derived tumor-like cell clusters from breast cancer tissue could be a metheod for omitting chemotherapy for her2 positive participants."

        "briefSummary": "Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) can be treated with drugs that kill tumour cells, stop them from dividing, or stop the growth of the blood supply that cancers need to grow and spread. Clinical research has shown that drugs that inhibit vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) or epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signalling can increase overall survival in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Preclinical studies have shown that vandetanib (ZD6474) is an inhibitor of both VEGFR and EGFR signalling. Giving vandetanib may therefore inhibit the growth of cancer cells by blocking their blood supply and by stopping them from dividing. This lung cancer study is to investigate if adding vandetanib to Alimta (pemetrexed) is more effective than Alimta (pemetrexed) alone."

In this study, we aimed to determine whether serum concentrations of TGF-β1, PDGF-BB and CTX-1 were related to the knee OA. knee OA cases were collected from the first affiliated hospital of Shihezi university and healthy controls were recruited from the community. The severity of knee OA was defined as kellgren-lawrence (K-L) classification criteria.Serum levels of chemical biomarkers were compared between knee OA cases and controls or among K-L grade 2 to grade 4 groups. The serum concentrations of the TGF-β1, PDGF-BB and CTX-1 were determined by ELISA ."
